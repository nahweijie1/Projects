I started reading and writing fanfiction about 10 years ago, first on quotev, then on tumblr, and finally on ao3 in 2015. I posted about 10 fics in the span of a year, ranging from about 1k words to 19k words. 

I fell out of love with the fandom that I was posting in, and my last fic was unfortunately left unfinished in 2017, and I have no plans on ever continuing it. My life moved on, and while I never stopped reading fanfiction, I completely stopped writing it. I would think about writing all the time, small scenes and short plot points would inevitably end up in my brain, but I haven't actually written anything since then.

Last month, I got really weirdly inspired. I planned out the basic plotline of a fic, and then began seriously writing for the first time in 5 years. I thought I would struggle, wouldn't be able to write very much and give up, but my goal was to get 15k words for this fic. It seemed like a pipedream, but I just hit 20k, and from my planning it looks like it will end up being about 50k. 

I've missed writing so much. I didn't realize it, the only writing I've done over the past 5 years has been acedemic.

&gt;!“I’ll rip your jaw from your head if you don’t shut up.” Diamondhead hissed, turning his arm into a blade. The Four Arms started breathing heavily, finally realizing that he was in danger. “You know, I’ve actually never done this before. I have no idea how hard it will be to cut your arms off. Thank you for being my Guinea pig.” He looked into the Four Arms eyes and saw nothing but fear; he almost felt bad. Almost. He started cutting into the arm at the joint, figuring that’d be the most accessible place to sever it. The process was slow going; his skin and muscles were very resistant to cutting. He added serrations to the blade before going at it again, this time it was easier. !&lt;

&gt;!He sawed his way through skin, muscle, and bone. It took a minute of straight sawing just to get to the bone. “Wow, you are resilient,” Diamondhead said. The Four Arms screamed and cried, begging Diamondhead to stop. The arm finally came off, landing on the ground with a thud.!&lt;

&gt;!“Please, I’m sorry. Just stop.” The Four Arms sobbed.!&lt;

&gt;!“You’re not sorry,” Diamondhead said coolly. “If I let you go now, you would have learned nothing. You’ll get more goonies, and then you’ll have them kill again. No, I’m not going to let that happen.” He mercilessly sawed off the other arm, ignoring the screams and pleas for mercy. When he finished, he released the diamonds holding him down. The Four Arms fell to the ground, sobbing.!&lt;

It's very much a secret hobby of mine that even my closest friends don't know about, primarily because I'm writing from the heart and only feel comfortable letting total strangers who don't know me read what I put out there.

Some highlights:

* I get around 400 or so hits between updates, something that has ballooned from practically nothing
* I have consistent commenters who love leaving paragraphs on each new chapter
* Some of my commenters have told me my fic is their favorite in the entire fandom (this makes me sob without fail every time I get this message)
* I have successfully managed to get my readers to laugh, cry, and send me (fake, joking) death threats over particularly dramatic scenes
* I've been praised for keeping my canon characters accurate to the source material 
* The readers like my OCs and actually requested for more appearances from some of them? I've always understood OCs to be fairly unpopular compared to canon characters so this one is huge to me.

I feel like I won the fanfiction audience lottery, and every time I receive a comment from someone praising my work I actually cry (and afterwards for the rest of the day I'm walking on air despite being unable to share this excitement with anyone else lol). However... this comes with the tradeoff that now I feel as though I have big shoes to fill. Imposter syndrome is hitting me pretty badly, because I feel like my readers would be disappointed if I don't put out updates that live up to the standards I'm making for myself. I used to update on a consistent schedule, but now they've slowed down. I've been sacrificing a few hours of sleep a few nights a week just to get a few more paragraphs written (why is it easier to write at night?), and I haven't drawn any fanart (what I'm openly known for online) in weeks.

What makes this even scarier is the fact that at the moment, I'm basically pantsing this thing. I know how I'd like the story to end, but at the moment I'm entirely winging it, trying to tie up loose plot threads and we haven't even gotten to the climax of the fic yet. I have ideas for a couple more chapters, but everything after that is just ??? (but I can't end it there; there's still story left to tell and I need to resolve everything). I'm stressing out over this like I used to when I had homework in college, but instead of grades it's making my readers happy. The kudos and comment emails are like pure dopamine being injected directly into my veins. aaaAAAAA

* Her not being able to deal with flowers after her miscarriage and him replacing her manicured beds with a moss garden and making sure everyone knows not to send her bouquets for anniversaries and such.
* Holding hands during an oration during grade school, because of fear of public speaking.

And then after all these memories, you find out that she is remembering them because he died. Young. (30's/40's) 

It is very left field, because another friend is there and they are sad about something and there is enough ambiguous references to her husband in the next room, that the reader thinks that her best friend became her husband later in life and that she and her friend are mourning a second miscarriage.

It's a big crossover/fusion that basically mixes every fandom I'm a part of and ones I was a part of in the past.

It's getting overwhelming. Whenever I want to watch/read something new there is part of my brain wondering how I could add it to the fanfic omniverse that I'm trying to build.  Whether it would go into the main verse as a fusion or fuse with one of the other universes crossing over or in its own seperate universe.

The whole premise is based on how in the multi/omniverse anything is possible and any alternates are possible as well. 

Fandoms that are set in the real world (like crime shows, med-dramas, low-fantasy, realistic/modern sci-fis, some comic books, etc.) are really easy to fuse together. Earth is a relatively big world and not knowing people in other places can be easily rationalized. A police officer in NYC doesn't need to know of some rich family on the opposite side of the world or even the opposite side of the same country. Things with off world settings can be explained similarly as it being a big universe. The ""hidden worlds"" concept of low fantasy and humans trying to rationalize anything that doesn't make sense to them also helps with keeping things fused but also seperate.

The ones that get more difficult (high fantasy and such) can sometimes be mixed themselves in alternate universes. Anything with a ""known world"" concept can semi-easily be explained as the other group was originally part of the ""unkown"" portion of their shared world. 

With their being fanfics of these ""difficult"" fandoms, that are set in modern times, there is the possibility that this modern version fuses with the others and the original or a similar to original setting is an alternate universe. Also fairy-tale and story retellings, as well as adaptations and and remakes work as alternate universes as well. 

This has extended not only with books, movies, and TV shows, but also some TikTok skit series as well.

With all of this worked mostly out about when I originally realized that my ideas easily mixed together. The above explanation was made to work with the original fusion/crossover idea but it made it way too easy to fuse and mix other fandoms in as well. 

My brain wants to mix everything regardless of my sanity, but it's getting frustrating.

There's further ideas but that's all I feel comfortable sharing. Would this be too controversial to write? How can you execute this in a way that people won't immediately be turned off by OCs?

I thought about writing this as an original piece but couldn't substitute the wizards for anything else, and so I thought, hey, fanfiction. I don't want to profit off of this - that'd be illegal - but I just thought this would be a cool idea to write.

If anyone wants to assist in further planning or whatnot, then by all means. I've not written in years and so this seems like a fun challenge for me. 😊",True,False,False,FanFiction,t5_2r5kb,260004,public,self,I have a story idea derived from HP but want to write my own OCs.

Farah and Alex are posing as civies while undercover in Rio, as they follow a lead on one of the cartel heads

they are ordered on standby as the other 141 members are stationed in other parts of the country to gather intel

While waiting for their target to arrive in a few days both take the time to get to know each other and go on a friendly date

for once in their lives they feel peaceful in this brief moment

a far off country where they had no personal stake in the mission

which for now was just to scout the area

for Alex who was been in this missions for the CIA many times before

this is different

he is now a free man well after all the world believes him to be dead getting away with 3/4s of himself intact

price treated him as if he weren't there to save him from being arrested by his former superiors

like the silent ally he is to the 141 never officially joining

for Farah this was something new, she grew up in war, its all she ever knew she was molded by it she never saw peace until recently

she saw how beautiful the place was the lush forests and blue sea, at first she didn't understand just why the country has its own different type of war, one that wasn't fought in the open both were in a state of bliss

by this feeling

when Alex heard Farah was in Brazil he immediately went to the person he respected and viewed as his only true CO

the only person that saw through him

for who he was they bought didn't have time to process their reunion as they had their hands full during the invasion of Verdunsk

""Lovely isn't it""? Farah asked.

""yes ma'am"" he answered ""its good to see you again commander""

""I don't usually have dead men as allies"" she chuckled

the 2 of them shared a laugh and went out as they shared more about themselves as they went out for a few bites, they appreciated each others company

later during after sundown they talked about what to do next after the missions over

she asked what if he's planning on staying ""dead"" forever

Alex says he hasn't been with his family ever since he joined the CIA and he can't come back to them in fear of their safety

something Farah didn't understand

as she'd give everything just to have her parents back

Alex dodged the subject as he told her he had to run something, clearly the topic rocked him

she felt bad about it

""Alex, I have 2 rooms in the block I'm staying, if you need to stay you're very much welcome."" she said

""nah ma'am I'm good I'd better be going, we got an HVI to look out for""

""they will arrive here in a few days according Nikolai's intel. you look very tired Alex you need rest, come."" Farah looked at him ""that's an order."" she said jokingly.

""thank you my commander"" they both laughed

after they reach the small trailer she was crashing in the two of them shared a smoke

talked more about their past experiences there Alex opened up to her about how serving with her seeing her cause made him more empathetic, and slowly gave him back his humanity and morals after seeing Farah be a symbol her fortitude in holding on to her beliefs, the reason we willingly risked his life for her

he inched closer to her

""you gave me purpose Farah, whenever I'm with you I'm more dedicated to it as ever, I did a lot of fucked up things before and I'm trying to make up for them""

Farah was taken back but saw how he really meant what he said

""you're a good man Alex, and we have all done some terrible things we regret we just live through them ask for forgiveness and be better""

Alex was about to lean closer to her but hesitated Farah saw this put her hand on his back

""Farah.. I care about you."" Alex took his hand and returned the gesture

before long they hugged.

""I like to be always serving under you Farah""

""Alex, I like your company too. you're the first person who was openly been honest with me, even my own brother couldn't do""

Farah told her how she felt and kissed him in the forehead

""I love you Farah Karim"" he said in a whisper.

both were into the moment before snapping back feeling awkward, Alex smiled at her ""I better get some shuteye"" said. ""thank you Farah. for everything""

""I have u to thank more for everything you risked for me.. rest well Alex""

""yes ma'am"" Alex replied in embarrassed voice hiding the fact that he's bluffing

Alex went to the other room,

Do siblings really only call each other by their names or insults? All the movies, tv shows, fics/books I can think of in english are usually like this. 

I was hoping someone could tell me if there was anything else I should know. Or just confirmation that they do indeed only call each other by their names or by insults. 

I'm sorry for my ignorance, English is not my first language. In my mother tongue we basically use brother/sister + name of older sibling, and even though I have no siblings, this also applies to cousins or people a few years older than you.

**Good Ending**

* The old plans of the good guys are destroyed and are to never be spoken again.
* The Protagonists proposed marriage to their respective Girlfriends, their respective Girlfriends have the same idea and proposed to their respective Boyfriends. All said Yes.

**Music** 

1.  Rest of my life -Bruno mars 
2.   Thinking out loud,Perfect-Ed Sheeran 

**Bad Ending (Continues from the good ending but without the Music)**

* A High ranking officer (The Good Guys) looks at a newspaper after sitting down in the office with a cup of coffee, and turning on a radio.
* Spits out the coffee, before saying oh no, and left the newspaper on the desk.
*  Headline: **Nation in Crisis Breakup of Federation, imminent?** 

Final Ending may be too extreme for some people. Please comment if it is too inappropriate for this Reddit.

&gt;!Nuclear ending !&lt;

* &gt;!A High ranking officer (The Good Guys)Turns on the radio.!&lt;
* &gt;!Looks out the window, while sipping coffee.!&lt;
* &gt;!Sees a Mushroom cloud in the distance.!&lt;
* &gt;!POV: People on the street. Sees the mushroom cloud.!&lt;

""Izuku Midoriya"" is fine, as long as it's consistent. 

Making Izuku marry Shouto Todoroki and changing his name to ""Izuku Todoroki"" is fine. Japanese women take their husbands' family name after marriage, guess gay couples can do the same if they want.

Honestly it's driving me nuts. Rules of English names don't apply on Japanese ones. I cringe so hard every time I see an author trying to give a Japanese character a middle name (assuming that they are not immigrants and the story set in Japan.)

Now, Chinese name. Any educated, sane, your every day Chinese people call each other by full name.

Earlier today when looking at the relationship tag I frequent, I found a story that had a similar concept to one I posted about a week ago, and didn’t think much of it at first since it’s not necessarily an uncommon concept, but I read through it and they definitely plagiarized me.

(sorry but this group is just SOOOOOO MUCH better than every other writing sub on this site)

I'm figuring out some short stories/hymns/poems to Athena. The first one is reworking/fleshing out her relationship with Medusa. Here's the relevant bullet notes:

* at first Medusa was simply the eldest of the three Gorgon sisters, no connection to Athena outside of the goddess helping Perseus kill her.
* then she got re-imagined as a priestess of Athena who did ""hentai things"" with Poseidon in Athena's temple, so Athena cursed her to be a gorgon
* then the Roman poet Ovid put out his fanfic, ""Metamorphosis"", where he was very salty about the Emperor Augustus pulling down his NSFW/18+ fics (and also for sleeping with his daughter) so he ""re-imagined"" the story so that Medusa is still a priestess of Athena but this time she gets {CONTENT WARNING} by Poseidon in Athena's temple. Athena (called Minerva, also a stand in for the mods) unjustly punishes Medusa for the crimes done against her.

Now...the lovely people at r/GreekMythology pointed out to me that Medusa being turn turned to stone was supposed to be a metaphor for vanity and hubris...because when you look at somebody through the eyes of vanity and hubris it steals all life out of them and reduces to being little more than stone. The shield Athena gives Perseus to defeat Medusa is mirrored not only for the logic of the plot put to also serve as a metaphor for how reason defeats vanity by showing itself to its face.

I REALLY like that btw. So I want to tell a version of the Medusa origin that reflects (pun and I don't regret it) that pay off. Athena curses Medusa by holding that reflective shield up to her face, which reflects the vain monstrosity she has become on the inside.

Now I'm just trying to figure out what exactly Medusa's vanity should be about. I'd like to get Poseidon into the story as well. On the one hand I want to get rid of the {CONTENT WARNING} because it goes so hard against the point of the story I'm trying to tell...on the other Poseidon is a first rate piece of s\*\*\* whose almost as bad a {CONTENT WARNING} as his brother Zeus. So I don't want this story to read like I'm trying to redeem him.

So, I started posting fics for my pairing. Because I'm not confident in my English writing, I just write them in my native language, and then commissioned my friend to translate them to English (because I know some of my international fellows are thirsty for contents). I even commissioned her to write some smut for them. And now, with 7 works I wrote in my native language, 5 works which are the translation of my friend, 2 works I commissioned her to write, 2 works from other fellows (god bless them), and 2 works with are the 3P with the ship I hate (so I skipped them), the tag for my ship finally became a thing in AO3. 

I know, 7 fics in 1.5 year is not much of an achievement, but I'm still kinda proud of it, like I actually did something meaningful for my OTP and some of my fellows out there. And even though I don't get much response, comments, hits and kudos are kinda rare, I'm still happy to express my feelings about the ship through all the fics. Also, knowing that some of my future fellows will go to AO3, search the tag and actually find something to read there, which is better than my situation in the past, is enough for me.

I also have all of my stories posted to Ao3 as well and know that the site doesn't have the same rules as FFN. I'm also not hating on this person (who will remain nameless) but rather I question their life choices...

I've known about that rule for years. Since I started writing fanfiction when I was 12 over a decade ago. And in that time frame, I have seen many - MANY - stories with explicit content that have been around for *years.* Some well written, some not. I just posted my first one-shot about a week ago and I am very proud of it.

Well, today I get another Review and it says...

&gt; While the writing quality of your story is good in terms of spelling and grammar, please note this part of the Content Guidelines:  
&gt;  
&gt;""Please note FanFiction does not accept explicit content, Fiction Rating: MA, and the rating is only presented for reference.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Remove all of the detailed descriptions of physical interaction of sexual or violent nature in this story if you want it to remain at this site, or upload it to a site where ""Fiction MA"" content is allowed like Archive Of Our Own.

Turns out, this person literally spends all their time reading through content, fishing for stuff they can report and adding it to their community that is specifically geared toward reporting. Now, I'm aware that there have been stories deleted from the site do to breaking this rule. But, I think if the moderators *REALLY* cared, there wouldn't be stories in this community that were posted in 2003 that are still around. *MAYBE* if they actually cared they would look through this community and go through the **4,000+ stories** this person has allegedly read. So, it is very possible some of you might have the same comment on one of your stories.

If reporting fanfiction helps them sleep at night, so be it. I just find if utterly confusing that someone would spend so much time going through SO MANY stories just to report them. It seems like such a huge waste of time to police the site when they are just an average user and don't have any real power. If they had any real power, there wouldn't be 4,000+ stories in their community that have yet to be taken down in the last 8 years that the community has been around.

If anything, I would think them creating this community full of explicitly sexual/violent content would have the opposite effect. Even I was like, ""Oh? Adult content all in one place, neat!"" It's a place where people who like that content can flock to and know exactly what's there.

Like to put it in the closest way possible that won't completely reveal what I'm writing about lol, imagine it's a fast food restaurant AU and the 28 year old is the floor manager, and the general manager tells this person to train this new 21 year old employee who also happens to be his child. And because we're suspending belief let's say that fast food retail is a sought-after career, so this general manager's actually wanting his 21 year old kid to eventually take up the position of floor manager, and the current 28 year old floor manager knows this, so they're kind of already closed off from the start with the new employee knowing that they're essentially training the person who's going to put them out of a job. But the new employee is actually a really nice person and also actually genuinely admires the floor manager for their work ethic and personality, and also pretty much has a crush on the floor manager on first sight.

The floor manager takes their job really seriously and is also really invested in being a good leader to their coworkers, so once they get over the initial resentment they actually try to train the new employee on the job. And really they don't really see each other in the capacity of a mentor/mentee, partly because the new employee doesn't really conform to the expectations for a junior staff, because they and the floor manager both know that regardless of what they do they would never get fired because they're the general manager, the actual boss's kid, and if there was ever anyone to be fired for anything, not even just a mutual romantic relationship, it would be the floor manager. Outside of work, they click, like they're a good support for each other for their personal struggles. But sometimes the new employee's youth will shine through (mostly just how carefree/worriless they are), and the floor manager will take note of it, and it's not a deal breaker for them (they think it's refreshing and gets the floor manager to have more fun but is also slightly naive), but at his worst it does make him feel like he's taking advantage of the new employee/their love, even though the new employee is usually always the one making the first move because a relationship with the floor manager is what they really want. Also, they're both bi, but the floor manager doesn't know it/has never had an experience with the same sex, while the new employee has had a lot of experience with the same sex, so when they do get together the new employee's the one who's having to guide the floor manager through their first romantic experience/relationship with the same sex.

This all kinda sounds funny to me now after plopping it into the context of a fast food AU lmao, but I just wanted to get people's thoughts about this dynamic: do you see a significant power dynamic in this relationship that's toxic/dangerous and would make the relationship unhealthy to pursue?

Now recently, a reader came and enjoyed the few chapters I did manage to post, and clearly enjoyed what I wrote, so when I explained why I dropped it, they requested me to continue it, and after exchanging a few ideas (turns out we were on similar pages about possible plots and all, so they were even willing to take a few of the plots I had planned), I gave them my blessing to do so.

I or we(if you want to write it as well, I have no objections) be making a Fairy Tail/One Piece crossover. Yes, an original idea. But anyways I've wanted to do this since I started watching One Piece for about a month now and I can say that I really enjoy. 

Now you're probably wondering, why Fairy Tail? Well, Fairy Tail is an anime that has a VERY easy crossover elements in it: known characters, magic and similar themes to most anime. But to be fair I want this fic to be more of a One Piece fic. For instance, the setting will be in One Piece, the plot we follow it and the 'magical' power system(no magical spells, only Devil Fruit Powers) in the anime/manga.

 That being said, I would like to add Fairy Tail elements to it as well. With it then it wouldn't be a crossover. Natsu will a Main Character and that actually isn't debatable. I'm sorry but he is actually very pivotal to the story. If you wish to know then we can discuss this over DM. Also Igneel. He is even more important to it. But other FT characters then we can discuss them and their importance to the plot.

To give even more context from the story to help you better understand, I'll tell you a little bit of why Natsu is so important to  the plot. In my/our fic, Natsu will know Luffy will be childhood friends and grow up together. Natsu will be live on the same island as Luffy starting from their age of 10(that's most likely the age he joined FT in the anime/manga but we don't know his real age) and before that he was with Igneel learning on how to be a great First Mate for the future King of the Pirates. Yes that is one of the main reasons why he is so important to the plot. He will be the First Mate of the Straw Hat Pirates. 

For more information, I can answer as much question as possible without trying to give away as much information as possible without trying to spoil the fic. I want to the readers have as little info as possible because I want that surprise effect when things happen. See you in the comments and thank you for taking the time to read my long winded post.

In addition, I have an undergrad in history and am something of a lore fanatic and extremely meticulous when it comes to world building.

I have a separate plot outline and a few experimental drafts to display my writing style if anyone's curious. Feel free to message me and ask.

Okay I have a story idea and in the history of Mr L he’s an Irish Catholic son of immigrants. Growing up in Brooklyn to keep up appearances as ‘good Catholics’ they would go to Mass and confession and all that with their neighbors. Mr L has a younger sister he gets custody of when Momma L dies and one day Mr L is passing through the apartment sees Sis levitating to draw on her ceiling. When he steps back after she noticed him there she is now standing on the frame of her bed to reach the ceiling. 

My idea is that he would start to assume she might be possessed and wouldn’t want to talk about it with her specifically on the assumption that when you confront a possessed person that is when the entity starts to act up. 

Would that idea drive you guys away from a story? Any feedback would be helpful it’s a really harsh history/nearly rivals relationship between the two.

When I try to write in the morning, it feels like trying to thread a needle with a sausage through a meter-long wall, but at night the plot bunnies and writing instinct prod at my brain so relentlessly that I can hardly focus on anything else but words and words and words and how to get them out and where they need to be and I constantly have the worry hanging over my head that if I don’t write it now, I’ll lose it later. Suffice to say, it’s not the most productive pattern.

The problem is I'm a bit stumped on what to do with her history.

From the poem, here's what I've gathered:

Link of the poem found here: [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Little\_Princess\_Mee](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Little_Princess_Mee) 

 \-*She walked by day/Under mantle grey/And hood of clouded blue;*=Days are spent in loneliness/depression and/or under the mostly grey skies.

\-*But she went by night/All glittering bright/Under the starlit sky,*=Is happier under the stars.

\-Loves to perform her nightly dance at her pool/at the beach where her only friend is her reflection.

\-An elf associated with the stars and the sea. – Could be a Teleris, a Vanyar or a Noldor (?).

With all that I'm wondering on what to do; do I make her a princess of Valinor? Could she be a daughter of Manwe and Varda or of Osse and Uinen? Could Mee be a granddaughter of both couples?

For all we know she could be Tom Bombadil and Goldberry's kid. Tough the thought of Tom and Thranduil being in-laws would be pretty funny (esepcially with Lee Pace's Thranduil), would Mee being a Bombadil be a legit claim? Both Mee and Goldberry are associated with the waters but it'd still be odd that Tom wouldn't brag about his kid like he does with his wife. And where was she during LOTR? Was she on her own adventure? Was she kidnapped/went missing? Why wouldn't Goldberry or Tom Bombadil look for her if that were the case?

And while we're on the subject, could Goldberry be the daughter of Uinen and Osse?",True,False,False,FanFiction,t5_2r5kb,259369,public,self,Any Tolkien Fans?:,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/t83xla/any_tolkien_fans/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've seen some other subreddits that post a ""Weekly Small Questions Thread"", where common questions can be grouped together in a single recurring thread that's pinned to the top of the feed and given a noticeable title.

Lots of questions are answered here on a daily basis, but none of the answers stick around long enough for other users to find them. They could search (and I certainly wish they would), yes, but Reddit's search function is notorious for being worse than useless sometimes.

It's quite a bit of effort to maintain a FAQ, so I figure an automoderator post once a week is less difficult.

But where as my original idea had some more merit, I ended up editing quite heavily from the initial scenario and have come to realize that my fic just feels like a parallel universe to canon. Not just an alternate universe, but parallel in the sense that different things happen but it almost follows the same consequences and resolution as in canon. Basically my fic feels like I'm just rewriting a lesser version of the canon story. 

While I wanted to really focus and dig deep on this character's thoughts and feelings in a way that doesn't get covered as heavily in canon, I'm afraid now it feels it has no purpose to being written and read by others. Thematically it feels near identical to canon. 

I know people write stories that are in depth companion fics to canon or fix it fics or utilize similar themes as canon. But for me, it feels like it sucks all of the motivation out of writing the fanfiction in the first place when I feel like there's nothing concrete enough that I can add to the fandom. And I don't mean add to the fandom as in it has to be the most original idea and no one else has written about this (I know for a fact other people have). Yet it might as well be original fiction at this point that I can comfortably modify more heavily and explore out of the limits of their universe.

No joke! I searched on all sorts of platforms and found nothing.

So, I plan to remedy that! 

Inspired by four pieces of works   *Harry Potter and the Bucketlist, Slithering Darkness,* *The Evil Overlord List,* and *Road to Power*   I give the first fem Tom Riddle SI, crossover fanfic (that I am aware of)!

This is going to be a part of the series that delves into the different worlds' problems, with more than one reborn character. How I'm going to divide the plotline into multiple books? I have no clue, but I do know it's going to diverge from the original plotline. You'd see what I mean when I start posting! And when I say, ""the different worlds' problems,"" I mean, the problem with the evil Dark Lord (the character ponders if she should make one for the benefits that come with war), Infinity War, X-Men, and the chaos that originates from Mystic Falls!

Anyway, I'll keep you guys updated with this little project of mine. Oh, also, mind helping me pick a fanfic title? I'm a bit stumped on this one. If you have any suggestions, please do share!

\- I tent to write too little context and when I notice it's missing, I write too much.  
\- I write in English, which is not my native language. It takes LOTS of time to write stuff out and my brain goes 713683561 times faster than what I can write.  
\- Visualizing the story is a real strength mine and helps with writing  
\- I write dragon ball Z fanfiction and lots of people still read this genre, but very few comment. Like that shit negatively fucks with my reward system :( I just want to learn to write for myself and better my writing skills!

I've been working for a few weeks on an actual novel. I have my characters arcs and profiles, my detail summary and now is time to write.

But, now is time to write and I'm starting to wonder is I should make this a fan fiction instead, to have it read by people and get opinions on the story. 

What do you think of this? Is it a bad idea?

Then, which fandom. I'm wondering: twilight? Harry potter? I'm familiar and comfortable with both. 

Let me give you a quick summary:

Mia is a 17 year old girl living with a depressed mother and an absent/abusive father. She finds a refuge in the many books she reads but one day, at the beginning of her last highschool year, as she is reading in a highschool corridor, she meets Alex, her new history teacher (who is 25).
Sharing first a common love for literature, they start a forbidden love story. But will this romance really give her the happiness she is looking for?


I'm dealing with the notion of growing up, escarping abuse and your own trauma, finding who you are and of course, true love :)

* Is it okay to cross-post a fanfiction to different platforms? What are the best ones currently? (I published *Antebellum* on Wattpad and FF so far, as I am still waiting for an invite to AO3... Is DeviantART still a thing, by the way?)
* My work tends to include generally mature themes, including themes of and depictions of mental illness and drug use. However, I don't write ""smut""/that sort of content. Should I still mark my work as M/Mature, or include warnings at the beginning of a chapter?

Thoughts? Should I include it in the tags or no?

So I go to implement this advice in my stories. I planned for two of my characters, a mother and son duo, to have a nuclear falling out with one trying to kill the other. So I started putting hints of this early. Literally chapter 2 of the story I start dropping clues to a dysfunctional relationship. The son thinks his mother hates him and the mother is starting to think of her son as inhuman(because of magical whatnots, don't worry about it). I develop this across the whole of the story. And then at the climax of the plot, the mother tries to kill him. When I dropped that chapter, my readers were like *WTF?!??!. Where did that come from?!? I hate this story!*

And here is the kicker. Some of them write actual critical reviews with their point being *You really didn't develop this and it felt like it came out of nowhere.* I read that and I am just like 'Listen here you little shi---'.

It's like salt in the wound to visit FFN and all of the old fics are labeled with ship acronyms and phrases that make no sense whatsoever and there's not even a place to look them up. Who the hell came up with these things? Like seriously, who sat down in the late 90s and decided that these ridiculous phrases should describe these ships? Portmanteaus of character names I could figure out, but damn, some of these are so convoluted that even revisiting the canon material doesn't yield any sort of clue as to who the intended pairing is supposed to be. The few fics I've read have had more than one pairing as well, so that complicates it further to try to whittle it down to context clues. I'm pretty sure that some pairings go by more than one ship name too, so it's not even clear from fic to fic and I think the fics either predate the tagging system on FFN or the authors were just lazy. Some are acronyms that are the first initial of each character and the letter ""R"" for romance, which would be fine if some of the main characters didn't share the same initial. Whatever happened to just writing a simple ""character 1/character 2"" in the description? Is that so hard, author from the early 2000s? I was writing back then and even my pre-teen ass knew no flowery ship names were needed. 

I don't really have much of a point here other than to rant (and maybe convince other fandoms to just use easier pairing names or write better summaries).

Hi! If this is against the rules I am so sorry, but I need help recovering an old fanfiction I read a long time ago on fanfiction.net.

It was an Ouran High School Host Club Fanfiction. I definitely read it before 2019, but I would say I read it closer to 2015?

The Hitachiin twins had a younger sister.

They were mean to her and tried to drown her when they were younger? Or something similar. But then the school her parents sent her to was like??? A secret spy school that had titles similar to chess pieces. And one of her missions went wrong and she was kidnapped.

There was a very specific scene where she answers a phone call and started speaking English very happily about a stuffed animal.

I feel like she did something weird with the ouran female uniform.

I feel like the word butterfly was in the title or the summary.

Finally, they concluded their comment as telling me again that my smut sucks and I will be a virgin forever. This is very rude and unhelpful. As usual, I deleted the comment. At this point, somebody tell me how to stop this troll from replying to me. Even replying to them will only make things worse.

I read and write and many fandoms, and generally I'm not picky. As a general rule I just want a good story with actual plot and character divelopment. I love time travel stories, and alternate universes, but those two are just ideas, in all seriusness almost anything is fine with me, if the stories is good. If it comes to romance I don't really care who's end up with who - of course I have my preferences, witch are different fandom to fandom, but as long as it's well-written and consentsual... just suprise me. I love long stories, as well. I have some examples for fandoms, but I'm always open to anything new as well.  So same examples...

If it's a **HP** fic almost anything goes with me. Plus points for your house if it focuses a bit on the friendship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, if Ron isn't stupid, and Hermione isn't perfect. I'm fourever on the hunt for interesting Slytherin centric fanfic, where they aren't one dimentional bad guys, but kids with their own personalities, in the middle of war. I also love the Maraduers, although Snape/Lily is a no for me, so is the Snape/Maraduers parings. 

If it's **SPN,** please give me something with a good case, and with with strong, helathy brotherly connection between Sam and Dean. I started the show for Sam and Dean, so I would stick with them.  I love family (blood family and choosen family) centric stories. I don't hate John or Mary, at so their timline could work as well. I love Bobby, Ellen and Jo, Jody,  they are more the boys family for me than anybody else. I love Cas as a character, but it's obvius, so maybe don't even need to be said. Again, I don't really care about ships, anything could work but pie for you as a reward if you could find something with unusal parings. I don't care if it's het or not, just give me something good. I'm a bit bord of the usual Dean/Cas and Sam/Eileen situation. 

If it's **Charmed** pls only recommend from OG. I tried with the reboot but it's not my cup of tea. I would love something wich takes places in Chris's dark future, and the more detailed the better. Angel wings for you if you have Phoebe and Cole in an interesting yet helathy relationship, but that's just a plus. I would also be happy with a story witch feacures all four sisters because I never read one of those before. 

If it's **NBC's Hannibal,** you will get an invitation for Dinner if your story have your own version of Clarice because I'm so sad this Hannibal never got his Clarice. Also plus points for Ardelia, because writers always forget about her, yet I love the strong friendship between Starling and Mapp. 

I'm also a **DC and Marvel** fan. (Yes, both.) If you have something with Arrow, pls, just please give me a break and drop something witch don't include Felicity. 

I love **Prodigal Son**, and if you have something in that fandom I would prefer a strange yet strong father son relationship between Martin and Malcolm, and a good case. 

Crossover fics are also fine with me. I think I rerly read good fics in the **Gilmore Girls** fandom, so if you have one of those, than coffee is on me at Luke's. If you have one in wich Dean Forester isn't the devil himself, add burgers too, because that boy as the bad guy is sooo boring I can't even tell you.

No hard feelings.**

I read a lot of smut.   
I'm sure a lot of you scrolling through this tag do as well. 

Anyways, I just started watching *Mr. Robot* as it is on my local Netflix. Great show, enjoying it so far. Like any other teenage (19 turning 20 to clarify, just so I don't get berated for being here) boy watching, I fall in love with Rami Malek. 

I've only ever seen him in one other piece of media, *Until Dawn*. Didn't think much of him then, but now... I... I am deeply in love with this constantly paranoid, drug addict vigilante. I'm captivated and falling into this deep dark hole of obsession. I think it has to do with my love of villains(?) despite Elliot, his character, not *really* being one. 

I usually read my daily dose of fanfiction over on *Tumblr*. However, the selection for Elliot fics over there isn't the best. So I move over to *AO3*. I'm not a big *AO3* person, but I have used the website before and have friends who are regulars. Good site, good finds. I sort by kudos and click on the first one. I don't think I'm allowed to recommend it here, but it only slightly has to do with this story/realization.

Great fic, absolutely losing my goddamn mind. 

As a virgin, touch-starved male, I get really horny reading smut. I've been reading smut for a couple of years now, but never really got horny back then? Like I never really felt *things*. But I guess being *alone* in quarantine and getting comfortable with being *alone* and doing *alone things* really changed that. (If you catch what I'm trying to say.) Anyways... as I understand it, I know people get all tingly in the feet when they're horny. Has to do with nerves and such. I think that's how it works right?

Anyways, I recently found out that in addition to that, my fingertips get all tingly. I don't know if the blood is rushing to my fingertips instead of my other parts but... my fingertips get all tingly and sensitive. It's quite embarrassing and I've been meaning to ask friends if they also go through that but I can't seem to confide in them.

So I've decided to confide in strangers online. On *Reddit*.  
So... does that happen to you? Can someone tell me the science behind that?

**TL;DR - My fingertips get all tingly when I'm reading smut. Does that happen to you?**

Originally, I thought that my protagonist's ""to-be"" love interest, would simply be a ""lowly"" Miner. Though it turned out to be tricky to work with. 'specially ways to make them get closer to each others.

The bigger/main reason though, is that their ""relationship"" would start off being like in many online games. 'specially those with beginer friendly communities. That a more experienced player (my protagonist in this case) would show a new player the ropes of a game. Or in this case, her new ""life"". (because of how ""drastic"" one's life will chang since becoming a Human-turned-Pokemon)

Think about the last movie you watched. The last book you read. The last character you fell in love with. Everyone has one. Or more.

When Arthur Conan Doyle killed Sherlock Holmes, thousands in London wore mourning. When Thanos choked Loki to death, thousands and more viewers echoed Thor's scream of denial. The Red Wedding left more people than you could imagine chilled and weeping or trembling. When Leonard Nimoy died, the papers carried the headline Spock Is Dead.

You know you've cried and laughed and cheered for people who you know to be completely fictional, but whom you can't help but love.

We weep and laugh with them. We tremble for them. We wonder about their pasts, about how they would react to something in 'reality.'.

These are people who apparently exist only in imagination, but are all beloved by more and with more intensity than most 'real' people. That carries power. Love, belief, faith. It all carries power.

 And now, what if these people, these imaginary characters, are real in every sense of the term? What if the Shire, the Federation, King's Landing, all exist in their own corners of the multiverse? And of the people who populate those world's, a selected few have received the adoration of other worlds.

 That carries a power of its own. Such people...they can't just fade away when the story is done. They exist, as real as anyone you pass in the street.

 In Valhalla. The home of heroes - but no, that is a mistranslation. It's not just heroes who are out there. It is every single person whose tale have been told and loved in worlds other than their own.

 Yeah, Captains Kirk, Picard, Janeway and Sisko are out there with their ships, Harry Potter and the Marauders are hanging out with each other, Frodo finally rejoined his friends... But Morgoth is there too. And Voldemort. And the Lannisters. Heroes, villains and monsters alike, given immortality by the power of words and imagination. 

They are there, continuing old and forming new rivalries, love affairs, alliances and plots. Some want power. Some want acceptance. Some want the revenge or triumph denied them in life. Some want to keep the weaker ones safe. Some want to hold the darkness at bay. Some...just want to be left in peace, to live, to rest, after the long battle that was their lives.

&amp;#x200B;

What will your favorite characters be doing there? Who will they ally with? Will there be groups and alliances - the Starfleet teaming up with the Jedi, MIB hunting Death Eaters and what other groups? How will they react to meeting dead enemies/friends/frenemies? Will they be thrilled to meet other heroes they thought fictional?

I knew I was gonna get some bad attention because ""I decided to publish on Wattpad"" and my story has a ""problematic"" ship (they are not the main ship).

At first, I was pleasantly surprised because I didn't get any negativity. I got the common comments, people reacting to some paragraphs, people talking to each other, someone roleplaying, and other people telling me how much they liked the story. Normal Wattpad stuff.

Then my story got popular, and I started to get comments from people hating the problematic ship. The funny thing here is that the ship shows up when the story is about to end, and it is revealed that some things happened because they are messed up (they are my Albus Dumbledore if you know what I mean).

It was at that point when I said ""OK, I'm not reading comments anymore."" Nevertheless, I ended up reading one. I don't remember exactly what they said but it was something along the lines ""they would have liked to know the ship was there before reading because they were enjoying the story and I ruined it.""

Then it struck me, this is not AO3. I tagged the ship but I people on Wattpad DON'T read tags. For some reason, these people get uncomfortable reading some paragraphs of the ship they don't like after I TAGGED IT.

Whatever. My petty side decided that I don't want these haters to enjoy even one word of my story. So I added the tags in the first chapter. Making it easier for people to know what they are going to find. 

Meaning, that now anyone who opens the story knows the ship is mentioned and sometimes I get 50+ comments of people who feel like they have to say they hate or like the ship.

I'm still not reading comments, but from time to time I get to see an email notification and notice people are fighting there. Antis vs Fans.

Oh boy, start from the third chapter, this fic suddenly, miraculously, inexplicably, becomes *god-tier*. With no exaggeration, the characterization is so canonical and vivid, and the plot is one of the most convoluted, well-thought I've read, and the writing is absolutely nothing short of divine. I finished this fic in one day without sleeping and left a super long comment to express my love to the author.

WHY? Why is the summary so bad? Why is the horrible writing in the first chapter look like it belongs to wattpad? This fic is soooooo good, and I regret to not read it sooner. For three years I didn't even spare it a second glance purley due to the devastating first impression it gave me. Honestly, I'm confused. It's not like the author is bad at writing (it's one of the most beautiful, fucking amazing fic in this fandom, I mean it) so why not put more effort in summary and the first few chapters?

I cannot believe I almost missed this gem under the dust. And certainly there're more readers like me, abandon this fic upon their first glance. :/

I felt so awful that I tried to rationalize missing my uncle’s funeral by saying he would have approved of my prioritizing fanfic over sleep.

You see, he was a huge Trekker, and I was reading every Sarek/Amanda fic I could find instead of sleeping the night before his funeral. 

So he would have approved right? 

Ridiculous.

Somehow, I convinced myself that was true for a couple of years.

Now, I fully acknowledge that missing his funeral is one of the worst things I’ve ever done. We were not close at all. I only saw him a couple times a year at most. But he was a cool dude. I really wish I had given him the respect that he deserved.

C’était un soir d’été. Avec mes parents nous venions d’emménager dans une petite ville située au large du Pacifique. Le nom était quelque peu surprenant “KimJong’île” mais d’après ma mère prénommée Carla, c’était le seul moyen pour elle de trouver du travail. Elle bossait pour ces grand entrepreneurs comme Bill Gates ou Jeff Bezos, cependant son employeur n’était pas réputé pour ses grandes valeurs humaines. Son nom ? Tom Nook alias le Hardi. Elle pouvait travailler 7j/7 et cela ne posait aucun soucis à Nook. En somme je la voyais peu. 

Des jours à rester enfermée dans ma chambre par dépit je décidais d’aller explorer les environs. Après quelques temps de marche en passant devant plusieurs enseignes tel que “Les soeurs doigts de fées” je tombais nez à nez avec un étrange personnage. À peine avais-je eu le temps d’ouvrir la bouche que cette espèce d’oiseau me cria “VAS-Y À FOND”. Outrée je reculais alors d’un pas, ce curieux habitant ajouta “Si tu veux encourager quelqu’un cette réplique est parfaite. On adore ça entre sportifs”. Apeurée je suis rentrée chez moi à toutes jambes. 

Le soir venu je ne cessais de penser à cette étrange rencontre. Qui était-il ? D’où venait-il ? Qu’avait-il de si sexy à quoi je ne pouvais résister ? Tant de questions.

CHAPITRE II
Lundi 3 septembre 2020, il est 7h47 quand la sonnette retentit. On frappe à ma porte, c’est Carla, ma mère “Enzo tu es réveillé ? Le car scolaire est devant, tout le monde t’attend”. En l’espace de 7 secondes j’ouvris les yeux et fit un bon de mon lit. Je pensais alors “C’est pas possible c’est la rentrée et je suis déjà la risée du village…”. Je me préparais rapidement et descendit. Dans le bus l’ambiance était froide, enfin surtout quand il s’agissait de moi. Après maintes arrêts le dernier passager monta à bord et nous nous sommes dirigés vers le collège. Je n’y avais pas fait attention mais ce dernier passager n’était autre que cet étrange oiseau. Il s’assit à côté de moi  comme pour me saluer et murmura “J’aime le muscle”, je ne pu m’empêcher de rougir. Quand le car s’arrêta il me fit signe de la main et ajouta “Au fait moi c’est PEC pezouze” avant de disparaître parmi les autres élèves.

Je vous passe le détail des classes, le discours du proviseur était trop naze. Malheureusement je ne suis pas avec PEC, il est dans la classe de Jhenifer qui, je l’apprendrai plus tard est sa copine… 

Première journée : ennuyante. Heureusement que je suis assise à côté de CHAUVE, c’est un vrai déglingos celui-ci. Il est nouveau comme moi alors on se réconforte. Il vient d’une petite ville non loin prénommée Baldpolis ; c’est cool.

CHAPITRE III
Ce matin pas question de louper le bus, j’ai pensé à mettre un réveil. Aujourd’hui j’ai décidé de porter ma plus belle tenue : j’ai opté pour mon gilet jaune agrémenté d’un superbe bonnet gland qui appartenait à mon père avant sa circoncision. Je ne vous ai pas dit qui il était d’ailleurs. Une fois ma mère tombée enceinte, il décida de se faire circoncir. Il se rendit alors chez Tom et demanda une circoncision.  L'opération ne se passa pas comme prévu, il perdit la moitié de son sexe et mourut d’une hémorragie appelée hémorragie du zboub. Je ne l’ai jamais connu mais je garde en sa mémoire ce bonnet gland. Enfin bon, c’est pas tout mais j’ai un pingouin à séduire moi ! Je descends à toute vitesse attrappe une pomme et saute dans le bus. 

Nous y sommes, c’est l’arrêt de PEC… Personne ne vient… Où est-il ? Les portes du bus se referment et le chauffeur ordonne son départ. Ni une ni deux je bondis et l’interpelle “Je veux descendre monsieur”. Surpris, il me regarda d’un air curieux, ouvrir la bouche comme pour contester cette demande mais rien ne sortit. Il ouvrit la porte et me laissa descendre. A peine je voyais le bus disparaître que j'imaginais déjà la réaction de ma mère quand elle verrait que j’ai manqué l’école…
“Trop tard pour les remords” pensais-je. Je m’avançais vers le portail, l’ouvrit, il grinçait, quelques frissons s’échappaient alors de mon ventre. Je me questionnais “Attend Enzo, t’es sûr que PEC habite ici ?”. Une minute s’écoula. Je pris place dans la cours. Je fus frappé par l’odeur qui émanait du jardin. Mais quelques coups d’oeil me permirent d’y voir plus clair. Le sol était jonché de débris en tout genre, je ne m’attardais pas longtemps à la vue de ce cataclysme (je précise qu’il y avait un bidon d’azote liquide tout de même). Cependant, il m’était impossible de partir d’ici sans trouver réponses à toutes les questions qui émergeaient en moi. Qui est vraiment ce PEC ? Pourquoi stocker de l’azote liquide dans son jardin ? Comment fait-il pour vivre dans une telle décharge. Je veux bien qu’il n’ait pas la main verte mais, tout de même, cela semble cacher quelque chose. 

    Après avoir attendu quelque minutes, je décide de rentrer dans la maison de PEC. Bon et puis zut ! A l’aventure… Même si je sais que cela constitue une infraction pénale, condamnée par la loi de 6 ans de prison ferme, jugée aussi gravement que la pédophilie. Non, je m'égare, fini les bêtises je prend mon courage à deux mains et j’y vais. Mais par où rentrer ? La maison de ce PEC n’a que très peu de fenêtre. J’en aperçois une à l’étage, ouverte qui plus est. Il est temps de mettre à pratique mes cours d’escalade, j’ai quand même participer à un stage cet été au club mickey ça devrait m’aider. Je grimpe d’abord sur une des sept poubelles posées contre la façade de la maison, m’accroche à la lucarne et hop : me voilà à la fenêtre. Je pénétrais alors dans la pièce assombrie par le manque d’éclairage… 

CHAPITRE IV
     Étonnamment, en essayant de m’avancer au sein de l’habitat je suis tombé du haut de la marche jusqu’au rez de chaussée. Qu’est-ce que ? Cette maison n’a qu’une unique pièce ? Je tombais alors une fois de plus nez à nez avec PEC qui s’interrogea “Tu vas monter un club de gym ? Si c’est le cas JE VEUX être membre”. Quel charabia, il n’a pas l’air d’être dans son état naturel… J’en profite pour observer les lieux. Pour tout dire il n’y a pas grand chose, c’est assez moche, presque lugubre. A coin de la pièce, un sac de couchage… jaune… Certains goûts à revoir peut-être. 

     Un silence s’installa. Je m’adresse à PEC pour primo atténuer ce sentiment de gêne et puis secondo comprendre pourquoi il n’a pas pris le bus ce matin “Ca va PEC ? Tu n’as pas l’air dans ton assiette?”. Surpris que je m’adresse à lui de façon sympathique il se mit à pleurer. Je fus surpris qu’il ne me demande pas ce que je faisais là… J’étais tout de même rentré chez lui par effraction !  Une fois ses larmes séchées, il bredouilla “C’est Tom, il m’exploite”. Je répliquais “Comment ça ? Voyons ne dit pas de sottises ! D’ailleurs tu ne t’affoles pas quand quelqu'un bondit de la fenêtre ?”. Il prit une grande inspiration et expliqua : En fait, je n’ai pas de famille poupousse. Je vis seul depuis que je suis dans le ventre de ma mère tu sais. Ici c’est mon refuge, c’est pas du luxe mais j’ai un sac de couchage jaune ! Et pour tout dire… Depuis ma naissance Tom Nook est le seul sur qui je peux me reposer, il m’a pris sous sa patte. Et moi... naïvement je n’ai pas su dire non quand il m’a proposé une maison au lieu d’une tente. Depuis cet agrandissement, il me harcèle. Il veut que je le rembourse. Alors il s’est chargé de rembourser ce prêt tout seul : il vend mon corps et utilise ma devanture comme décharge. Mon client du moment, Ramsès le chien momie, aime se déguiser en Spider Man, voilà pourquoi je ne suis pas étonné de voir une silhouette surgir de la fenêtre.Voilà… Tu en sais trop pour être mon ami maintenant Enzo j’imagine ?”
Je répondis “Oui” et pris la fuite.

It can be difficult to figure out how to encapsulate the mood, intent, and general theme of the narrative in a short little snippet that's both snappy and eye-catching. The key here is to truly know and understand the inspiration and themes behind what you're writing, be it one chapter or titling an entire work. What are some points of inspiration you can pull from that can inform your title in a way that feels natural yet enticing to a prospective reader?

Now, I do personally find that this comes with practice, as your brain simply gets trained to think of these things in more abstract ways and find more efficient means of articulating said abstractions, but for the sake of example, I have pulled one of my comments from another post on here to give some ideas on how I've created the titles for my works thus far:

My longfic novel series is called ""The Phantom Dragon"", referring to the Phantom Thieves of Persona 5 as well as the Dragon motif prominent in the Yakuza series, with this novel series being a crossover of the two. The ""Phantom"" also refers to the main character being something of an interloper, someone who doesn't belong in the situation or locale he's placed in, who one day will simply disappear from said situation. The ""Dragon"" also refers to his heritage, as well as the concept of the ""Dragon"", the holy and stalwart defender of the heavens in Japanese mythology; the ultimate warrior of strength and virtue.

Book 1 is titled ""A Way To Fall"", after the credits theme of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. This song is all about a parent (especially within that game's context) talking to their child about all the hardships they've endured in their lives and how the road ahead is going to be a rough one for the child. This also comments on a loss of innocence, which is integral to the story of part 1.

Book 2 is ""The Honest Price"", referencing ""Price"", the theme of the villain of the arc in Persona 5 this book is primarily inspired by, as well as commenting on the real price of the arguably self-destructive heroic acts the main characters have undertaken in pursuit of justice, which also speaks strongly to the plight of the second protagonist, being a police woman caught up in a complex mob plot.

Book 3 is ""For Truth and Justice"", foreshadowing how it's a crossover with Persona 4, who's main theme was ""Truth"", with Persona 5's being ""Justice""/""Rebellion"". This book is all about reconciliation with oneself and those around oneself, finding the ""Truth"" of one's place in life and using that to pursue a more true and virtuous ""Justice"".

We then have book 3.5, ""The Mark of Heresy"". This is all about explaining the fantasy elements that have slowly crept up into the story, while exploring the backstory of the third protagonist, which heavily focuses on being raised in a cult, which his acts of heresy against have left him ""marked"". This is also a metaphorical mark, as the heretical acts he has undertaken leads him down an even darker, heavily scarring path.

Finally, Book 4: ""Fulfiller of Faith"". This has many references within it, at first referencing Yakuza 4's theme song ""For Faith"", and Yakuza 5's Japanese subtitle, ""Fulfiller of Dreams"". This final part is all about the main heroes fulfilling the ""dreams"" lain down by those that came before them, those who ended up putting their ""faith"" in younger, newer heroes to end a generations-long conflict. The main character ends up truly becoming the ""Fulfiller of Faith"", as all the trauma and pain everyone around him has experienced until now ends up culminating in one great, final victory made possible through the ""Faith"" of those around him. 

...

The core idea here is articulating abstract themes in efficient, enticing ways. Obviously, it doesn't need to be this complicated, but even when simply titling one chapter, think of some core element of the events of that chapter to focus on, and formulate a title from that core event. Training your brain to think in this way will greatly help you to create effective titles in less and less time as you continue to practice it. And while some of my points have been centered around music, I'd advise using this technique sparingly.  Not everyone will know every song that inspires your work, so I'd take inspiration from songs with more poetic, abstract titles that can help illustrate your ideas and themes without having to actually know the song itself. Your summaries, another Achilles' heel for many, will be improved by this as well.

There's this fanfic that I read years ago, which I can't remember the name of either the title or author. I have laid down a fair amount of time to look for it, but no dice.

I will write down a summary of how I remember it. If you know of this fic or something like it, I would truly appreciate the help in finding it! :).

Summary/Details:
This fanfic is posted on Fanfiction.net and is about Teen Titans along with the Justice Leauge. 

The story takes place right after the ""Trouble in Tokyo"" movie from Teen Titans. Robin and Starfire has broken up and things are a bit tense in the team. And their tension truly shows itself when a bank is robbed by Two Face and his men. Robin has history with Harvey Dent, him being the last villain he fought when he was with Batman. And his presence kind of messes with Robin as they fight, along with the tension in the team. And from there, the Titans keep on facing obstacles after obstacles. 

There's a tie in with the Justice Leauge in this, along with most of the DC universe. Batman has scenes with Robin, and it's a pretty neat story with a lot of different interactions with both villains and Heroes in DC. Two scenes I remembered specifically is when Raven listens in on Robin talking to a ""shadow"" (Batman) in the Titans Tower. And I also remember Batman pointing a younger Raven in the direction of Jump City when she was denied help by the Leauge.

I don't remember many details unfortunately, but there was supposed to be a sequel. The last chapter ended on Slade's daughter being introduced, analyzing the Titans one by one under the watchful eye of Slade. Along with Demain Wayne holding a speech of some kind to the shadow assisns/Followers of Rahs. Might've been something with Sportsmaster too, but I am not sure.

The main ships in the story are ""Robin and Raven"" along with ""Batman and Catwoman"". There's a small scene where Batman and Wonder woman talk about how their romance didn't work out as well. There should be more ships like Jinx and Kidflash sprinkled in there, but I don't quite remember. 

I do remember that the author made some Wonder Woman/Batman stories too. But I don't remember a lot about them. One had something to do with Batman taking a day off, and Wonder Woman wondering why he always did during this specific day. And there was a villain attack where the villains ended up disturbing a grave yard. And Batman swooped in and was like ""I thought you people at least had some decency"" or something as they trashed gravestones and such.

Anyways. If anyone knows anything about this fanfic. I would love to hear and it would be a great help to me if you shared! 

I wish everyone a great day and good fortune ahead!

  I'm not here to tell you which side is in the right. Every one has already picked one. Instead I want to look at the circumstances that made this even possible.

 Namely, the platforms.   

  
  Platforms, like twitter, youtube etc  are the only one materially benefiting from a heated culture war. Pro and antis create lots and lots of *contend* about how the other side is terrible.   

  
  I'm not the first one to point out that many platforms are designed to promote the most devising, extreme opinions leaving no room for nuance.   It's build into their algorithm, into their character limitations.   

  
  I think people are starting to recognize the roles of platforms when it comes to canceling and  radicalization and other forms of online terribleness. But I've yet to see someone make a connection to the culture war in fandom. 

  
  So what's the solution? I'm not gonna pretend that I have an answer. 

  But I do think, we need to get away from being angry at individuals and groups of people and look at the systems.

I did a lot of work to make the story remain true to both the original work and the setting, and it’s something I’m fairly proud of. 

A few months after I published the final chapter, someone else took my premise, with the same pairing, and did their entire own spin-off of it without giving me credit. It was very obvious that this fic lifted ideas and concepts from my work, with a lot of highly specific details taken directly from my story. This author had also commented on my fic before, so I knew this wasn’t a coincidence. Someone actually called them out for the similarities, and the author took it down in a panic. 

They just started uploading it again, this time with acknowledgment that their work was based off of mine and no changes whatsoever to the story. They left a comment on my original fic, asking for permission after the fact, and then just posted it anyway without my response.

I wanted to let this go, but I started reading through it, and there’s a lot of stuff in this story that’s in very poor taste. There’s a lot of factual historical errors, but there’s some very uncomfortable connections this person made between fictional characters and actual historical atrocities that I deliberately avoided for very good reasons. I feel a little guilty that I somehow inspired that mess.

I’m also at a loss because while they didn’t copy and paste my text, they definitely lifted ideas wholesale from my work. I don’t feel any sort of ownership of this particular idea or anything, but there were far too many similarities for it to be just another historical AU. It’s a fan work at the end of the day, so I can’t really complain about “plagiarism” in the traditional sense; it still feels wrong, somehow.

Then recently I came across this beautifully-written fanfic with art where the author said that English was not their main language because they were *insert country*, and apologized in advance. 

All they did was write a story and a character analysis exploring a character in a different way. The feedback was good, until someone who blatantly stated that they were a logged-out user, told the author that their English was bad, that their interpretation was horrid, and that it's unpopular because they don't engage with the fandom... An English-speaking fandom. No constructive criticism, all flaming.

Then after attacking the author they told them that they were going to follow the fanfic just for the art?

I'm not here to specifically bash anyone or anything, because discrimination is present in many fandoms. I'm just wondering what is the mentality in doing things like this?

The author deleted their entire account and orphaned the fanfic out of anxiety, it was never completed. It's so painful to see perfectly good work gone. What bothered me even more was that the setting of the content they were making a fanfic of is literally based on a historical period of that author's country. I was so excited to read a fanfic from a local perspective. But just like that, gone.

One of my friends is a refugee who struggles learning English, and tries their best to speak the language to adapt, but they still get made fun of for having an accent. I always tried to comfort them when they were stressed at expressing themself publicly outside of their native language.

It made me realize that as an English speaker, I have to be grateful that my language and culture is the one people adjust to, so I can freely enjoy content coming from people with different backgrounds. :(

I normally don't rant like this, and I'm not active in this sub because I really only read as a pastime, but I just couldn't help but wonder why these things have to happen...

It was a NSFW Overwatch fanfiction (listen I probably read it in like 2017 so don't judge.) featuring the cowboy then known as McCree (who from now on in this post will be referred to by his new name) and Hanzo. If memory serves Cassidy was selling something (sunflowers I think we're emphasized??) at a roadside stand, products from his farm, and Hanzo who was a chef comes by and they talk and flirt and what not. Eventually Hanzo returns for ingredients because they're so farm fresh and such and things go from there?  


The other details I remember was that Hana, Lucio, and Bastion were kids in a hospital? I think Hanzo had custody over Hana, and because he's worried for her he ends up marrying Cassidy for her own good just in case something happens to him, she'll be taken care of. I also believe he went on a trip to Japan leaving poor Cassidy all forlorn because he thinks the guy he's in love with is off galavanting with some chick he keeps seeing in photos with him who turns out to be his cousin, oops.

So, I've had this fanfic idea for a Reader x Character within the Harry Potter world for about 6 years, and I'm finally motivated enough to write it! The issue is: when I first started, my early drafts were a Reader self insert (Y/N) 1st person pov (eg. ""My friend waved back - *Hey y/n, wait for me!*""). But now it's been many years, my writing has massively improved, the story has changed quite a bit, and I'm not sure if by using y/n, my story will seem less... fleshed out? less mature? Basically I'm trying to avoid the cliché ""y/n-badly written romance-my parents sold me to 1D"" vibe, but still making it a reader x character.

I've thought about just creating an OC, but I really wanted the MC to be as neutral (physically) as possible, as I wanted that self-insert component. I've considered giving her a name, but keep physical descriptions to a minimum (no mentions of skin tones, hair colour/texture, etc). The reason why I'm doing this, it's because I've always enjoyed Reader X C fics, but as a poc girl, I've seen too many phrases like ""you tied your long straight into a messy bun"" ; ""my pale skin looked even brighter against his golden arms""; etc (you get my drift).  Not sure whether 1st person or 3rd person would suit it best (crude example bellow, let's call her Jane in this case).

1st person - *I could feel my cheeks burn when he called my name.*  ""Can I seat here, Jane?""

3rd person - *She could feel her cheeks burn when he called her name.* ""Can I sear here, Jane?""

I know it's very common to use 2nd person pov *(you could feel...)* in these type of fics, but I'm personally not too comfortable with that, nor I think I would suit mine (but I've read amazing fics with it! just personal preference!). I guess my question is: will giving MC a name take away the insertion aspect, and if not, which pov would suit it best.

I even debated with making a love triangle and letting readers vote later.  To keep the post as brief as I can, I might leave out details, so I apologize in advance.  

**Setup**: What sets the plot in motion for the fanfic is when Character A gets seriously injured and nearly dies.  He faces permanent damage that affects his future as a warrior.  Personality wise, Character A is serious, disciplined, stoic, and pessimistic at times.  He's facing issues with PTSD from some incidents in the past, especially from a more recent time period.  He also has abandonment and distrust issues from having a turbulent past.

**Contenders**

*Hero in Training (HIT)*: Years ago, this character was friends with Character A when they were kids.  They went to the same academic school and martial art school, acting as friends and even rivals at times.  He was Character's A first and only friend at the time.  Then things turned sour.

Due to a combination of a misunderstanding, something traumatic happening to HIT, and manipulations by an antagonistic character, HIT distrusted and got angry with Character A and distanced himself from him.  By the time HIT calmed down weeks later, Character A stopped going to both his academic and marital art school they shared (Character A snapped on some bullies, which got him him booted).  HIT regretted how he let everything end to this day.

Now, years later, he found Character A's location during a newscast that showed he was hurt.  HIT trying to make it up with Character A by apologizing, helping Character A with his recovery, and trying to befriend him again.

Personality: He's a patient and laid back guy that is able to make friends easily and gets along with most people.  He has super strength guy but is also a gentle pacifist who detests violence and roughness. However, he is willing to use his strength and fighting abilities when needed.  He can even have a secret temper when people he cares about is threatened.  While his life goal is to travel to various places, he strives to be a hero that helps people as another goal.

*Idealist Time Traveler (ITT)*: He's a time traveler from the future.  Was close friends with Character A for several months/ a year (haven't decided yet) before he shows up in the fanfic.  However, due to new positive timelines slowly rewriting his older memories, he forgot a lot of time he spent with Character A.  Also, Character A had a crush on him from the beginning, but he found out right before he was going to confess that ITT developed feelings for someone else in his own timeline (ITT wasn't ignorant of Character's A feelings for him).

After his timeline gets changed for the worse again, ITT returns in the past to find Character A hurt, which greatly upsets him.  He manages to pull Character A out of a coma and uses his powers to help Character A with communication at first (Character A had a breathing tube in for several days and ITT can read minds to a limited extent).

Personality: A kind-hearted idealist that tries to see the best in people.  Intelligent but naive at times.  Wears his heart on his sleeve a lot, including negatives emotions like anger and sadness.  Strives to understand people better (I'm having a subplot where he seriously considers becoming a psychologist).  Has a strong sense of justice and tries to make things right when he can, sometimes to a fault.

**Question**

Which romance option would  likely make the story more interesting?

Basically peter lived full time at the tower and Tony(and maybe steve - i think it was stony too) was his dad but no one knew about spiderman. While doing superhero stuff, Peter runs into Wade and they start hanging out and working on superhero stuff which eventually leads to dating. I don't remember all the details but at some point the avengers find out that peter is dating wade and is spiderman. Towards the end, Peter got like captured or disappeared and wade &amp; the avenger had to work together to find him. I'm not sure about this but I think there was something with age where wade refused to do things with peter until he turned like 18 or something. Pls help me find it!

I know everything that is supposed to happen, the OCs have their own distinct personalities, they all have side arcs that come together, but I just don't feel like I want to write about this for some reason?

I had to stop these last few months due to RL concerns and during that time I just wrote for a couple of side-stories in different fandoms. During that time, one of my friends fetishized my OC to the point where I can no longer look at him the same way. I've told them why that character isn't who they think he is (they seem to think he's just a bad boy stereotype when he's an awkward sociopath who is pretty much a coward) but everyone should get to keep their own interpretations of fictional works. I've introduced that friend to this fandom so I don't think I should try to dictate how they feel about certain things but it's so frustrating to explain the complex mental health issues he has and just see that friend carry on with more fetishizing because he so ""strong"" and ""handsome."" That OC used to be my favourite for the amount of suffering I subjected him to, to see him become a better person by the end, but these few months have sapped all that.

Now that it's time to go back to my longfic, I'm slightly overwhelmed. The scope of the story seems to paralyze me (I have six to seven characters of varying importance and dozens of medium-level characters, all going through a major civil war and then an apocalypse) I just feel like I should pause but then I might not return and I've planned this story too much to abandon it.

But when is it a valid to use it?

For instance, let's say you enter a fic that is tagged with a specific genre that you don't particularly enjoy (I for one don't read tragedies, breakups, or betrayal fics), or a pairing you're not a fan of, and then you complain about it.

On the other hand, let's say you enter a fic tagged with a pairing you like, but find a lot of narrative flaws, like the story being too rushed, the characters being OoC, or that its full of typos and grammar errors that make it a difficult read, and you tell the author about this.

I remember one specific case of a story of which I took a peek to the first chapter, and decided to not go any further because I was sure I wouldn't like it. The author however insisted that I would enjoy it and ""after chapter X I wouldn't be able to drop it"". Suffice to say that it was a heavy read for me, and when I pointed out the flaws (included bot not limited to: slow development, too much focus on the romance, OoC abound, and lack of narration in battle/action sequences) after reaching said chapter, the guy would just insist that I went a few chapters further, citing ""improvement later"". But nope, it only gets worse, especially with the appearance of a blatant God-Mode Stu Author Avatar that pretty much takes over the plot as soon as it appears, even eclipsing the alleged protagonists. So the guy goes ""If you don't like it, then why'd you read it?"". Er... because you insisted me to do so? Now because of that, if someone asks me to read something I'm certain that I *won't* like, when I say no, it's no.

Here you can look for a Beta, a Co-writer, or a Writing Buddy  for your fic or offer your Beta services to fic authors.

Please note that you can *request* a beta reader even if you can’t offer anything in exchange, however it will increase your chances of finding a willing beta if you offer something in return.

The rules are straightforward.

* Make a comment below with the following information.
* Reply to people that you want to trade with. There is no one making matches for you, reach out to likely people in the thread.

If you're **looking for a Beta, a Co-writer, or a Writing Buddy:**

* Name and Link to your fic (if it's not published, link something else as an example of your writing).
* Tell us what fandom you're writing for.
* Can someone who isn't in your fandom make sense of your story?
* The genre of your fic - romance/smut/gen/mystery/horror/etc.
* What you're looking for from a Beta or a Co-writer - Grammar/Structure/Plot/Planning/Idea soundboard/etc.
* What your projected word count is.
* How frequently you update.
* What fandoms you are able/willing to beta for **or** what you can offer in exchange\*.

**Proposed options for no exchange wording:**

* If you do not want to offer something in exchange, please leave a brief note that you are unable to offer anything at this time.
* Note: If you are unable to offer something in exchange at this time, please leave a brief note explaining.

If you're **willing to Beta** for someone:

* What fandoms you're well versed in or if you're willing to take on anything.
* Preferred genre/types of fics.
* Any subjects you're **not** willing to tackle.
* Types of Betaing you're good at or willing to try - Grammar/Structure/Plot/Planning/Idea soundboard/etc.
* Minimum or maximum word count.
* One-off (single session) or ongoing Betaing.
* Time constraints. Do you have a fast turn-around time? Is it going to be more than a week for you to get back to an author with notes?
* What you'd like in exchange \* for your services.

\* **Bartering Ideas!**

Since some people want Betas but are too busy to reciprocate or aren't confident in their writing skills and some Betas don't write fics themselves, you can offer other things in exchange. Please do not offer monetary exchanges.

If you aren't sure what to offer, you can also open this up to the Beta to suggest a barter in exchange.

Here are a few ideas for bartering:

* Reciprocal Betaing (of course that's welcome!)
* Reading and commenting on their fics.
* Write a fic for a fandom/subject/pairing/brotp of their choice.
* Make fanart for them.
* Name an OC after them.
* Edit/give assistance with a non-fic project.
* Research help for this/future fics.

Feel free to get creative, people have many specialties they can draw on!

I write fanfic. I am relatively popular in my particular niche.

I often times - not just once or twice, but often, will receive comments on ao3 and twitter along the lines of “Aren’t you a grown ass man? Don’t you have kids to feed? Bills to pay?” I received an ao3 comment the other day that was along the lines of “you’re like 40 years old why are you writing this shit?” and another along the same vein being “the author of this fic is literally 35 y’all 💀💀💀💀”

I just genuinely don’t understand this type of sentiment. Not only is 23 and 35 a pretty extreme age jump, I just don’t understand the newfound hostility towards older writers in general. And I’m not calling myself old at all. I am young. I don’t understand why these people will see someone above the age of 18 in fandom and producing content and automatically picture in their mind someone who is out of college, has a full time job, a family and no time for hobbies. I also don’t understand the way they sling ages around as if it is an insult to be an adult and have a hobby in fandom. When I was 14/15 and reading Mortal Instruments fics on ff.n one of my favorite authors kept the readers updated on how her 3 children were doing before each chapter of her fic, and I thought that was the coolest thing ever. I just wonder what’s changed in the past few years of online culture to make teenagers see an adult in fandom and automatically assume they’re on their own, have a family, have their life together and shouldn’t be participating in fandom.

It’s just strange to me how someone can see that I’m in my early 20s and for some reason think that that age is the exact same as someone 20 years older than me. This is more of a vent than anything, it’s just frustrating being a new adult and teenagers in fandom spaces automatically assuming I should have a white picket fence life and that you should have no hobbies once you reach adulthood, I guess, along with how they seem to think being an adult and interested in fandom should be a shameful thing.

Basically, post-Reichenbach, John is thrown forward in time by Moriarty and ends up on the Enterprise, after *Into Darkness*.

A major part of the fic was that Moriarty had effectively brainwashed Sherlock into becoming Khan, and John was trying to get him to remember who he was.  
It also had John getting sicker and sicker due to the stress of time travel, until he almost died. 

The fic ended with Sherlock retuning to their time period alone, as John was too sick to return.

My sister started writing fanfiction for the first time today. I've been writing for four years and posting for two.

I'm honestly surprised it took her so long to start. We talk about fanfiction almost every day. She has 1000 fics saved on her phone as we speak. All she ever talks about is fanfiction, which I'm perfectly okay with because I love talking about it too.

She was an English Major in college as well.

I have to help her with some of it though. She isn't sure how to show POV changes or how to separate the story from the prologue. She also isn't completely sure when a chapter should end and when a new one should begin. That's perfectly fine, but it gets a little annoying three chapters later lol. Still, I hope she does well. 

She's actually listening to my help, which is great! One thing she complains about when it comes to fanfiction is that she doesn't like fics that are almost exact copies of the original source material. I noticed she was doing that very same thing and pointed it out. She was happy that I did because she didn't even realize she was doing it. She added new dialogue to help spice it up.

It's not an unreasonable thing. I'd already decided the story was going to be a series, but the parts are still too unwieldy. And I think it's better to break it into pieces because it allows for more precise tagging and relevant summaries.

It's so massive, it's impossible to write a succinct summary WITHOUT breaking it into pieces.

And that's going to mean preserving reader comments in a truly asinine way. Either, I cut-paste them directly into the Comment section for each chapter as I move it to a new entry in the series (which is where I'm leaning), or I leave the chapters up and strip the words, bloating the chapter count while-no, screw that. Even as I type it out, I realize how dumb it is.

I could always just delete the chapters and let the comments vanish into the ether, but screw that, too.

I am looking for any high-quality crossover where one-half is normal people, usually police (eg, NCIS, Criminal Minds, Numb3rs, etc.), crossing over with a fantasy/sci-fi work (Dresden Files, Supernatural, Grimm, etc.), and the normals don't know the fantastic exists at the beginning of the fic. Don't care if they know by the end, or they are completely blind to it. Please, no romance-focused recs. It only distracts from this kind of story, IMHO.

Maybe this can help someone else in the future who has the same questions I do, lol!

I'm writing a story where one of the MCs has a pet (an OC pet, not a canon pet). They've been in the fic since the beginning, and the readers have gotten attached to them. However, I've reached the point in my outline where I planned to write their death (a peaceful one; old age). The death scene itself happens offscreen, with the aftermath being written. 

\-Would this be considered a MCD? They're not the focus of the story, and are only mentioned in passing when appropriate.

\-Should I tag this as ""Animal Death""/""Pet Death"" in the tags? They're the only animal in the story itself and the death happens over halfway through the fic.

\-Should I mark this as a trigger warning in the author's notes (either the beginning notes or a ""skip to the end"" spoiler-prevention note)?",False,False,False,FanFiction,t5_2r5kb,257306,public,self,Questions About Pet Death,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/t5fbnz/questions_about_pet_death/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sad thing is, the characters have so much potential for so many found family fics. And healing fics. And I want to write these found family/ healing / just vibin fics, but I don't know the characters all that well. 

Alas, the entire Fandom consists of horny teenagers who don't understand why you probably shouldn't ship a teenager and someone who's in their mid twenties. Especially when the elder views that person as a sister. 

I get their general demeanor, but it's not nearly enough to write the character. If im going to be the sole found family writer in these parts, I want to do it right, you know? The wiki is bare bones and the reddit consists of said horny teens who don't give a shit about the actual characters. So I'm left to read the source, and.. I still don't get them. These two don't get much screen time.

 So either I write OOC or I write them as shells.

This thread is for sharing positive feedback and reviews with your fellow fanfictioneers!

No concrit, no nitpicking, no grammar checks, no ""I don't like this part because..."" NOPE! None of that, nada, zero, zilch. We've got a weekly thread on Saturdays for constructive criticism if that's your preferred style of feedback.

**Key Rules for Participation:**

* If you're posting in this thread you **must** leave a review for someone else. This is a community based thread, and therefore needs the community to be involved so that it is fair for everyone.
* **30+ words** when leaving reviews, please. This is to promote fair play and level the field. If you want to ramble on from there, go right ahead!
* Quoting parts of the fic ***does not*** count toward your review word count.
* It is **highly encouraged** to review in this thread **and also copy/paste it to the actual fic or chapter they've linked.**
* If you see something **that doesn't have a review yet**, please try to give it a read to spread the love around.
* If you have the time, reviewing more than one fic would be a thoughtful thing to do.
* If you just want to hang out and review fics without putting in your own, you're more than welcome to!

**Posting Fics for Review:**

* Select a passage from a fic you want a comment/review on. There is a **hard limit of 600 words**.
* Top level comments should be fic snippets.
* First line should be Fandom | Title | Rating | Link - AO3, FFN, etc.
* Copy and paste your fic tidbit directly to the thread *unless* it contains Mature or Explicit content.
* If the fic contains Mature or Explicit content (explicit sexual situations, extreme depictions of violence, or underage content), please provide a link to these fics with appropriate tags and warnings.
* If your fic contains this content but the specific scene you've chosen to post does not, please warn those who might go link-clicking about the content in the rest of the fic.
* If you, for whatever reason, would not like the review also put on your actual fic, please say so.
* **Reminder: If you contribute a fic, you must leave a review for someone else!**

***

Formatting example:

**Fandom | Title | Rating | Link to offsite**

(new line, double enter) *Any applicable warnings*

(new line, double enter) Your fic text.

***

**Tips and tricks for leaving a positive review:**

* When a line catches your eye, quote it and say what you liked about it.
* If there's an overarching theme or technicality the author did well, point it out.
* You may have no clue about the fandom, but did you get a good sense of a character, or the scenery, or the plot, the action, the feeling of the scene, the interactions, the dialogue? I'm sure they'd like to know!

I'm seeking advice/ just looking to get this all off my chest at the moment.   


I started posting my first long fic (ever), and I'm about 50k in and it's grown to be somewhat popular- which is amazing! I love talking with everyone when I upload, and I've been getting really good reviews. Yay! But I've also been putting up with some Not Great Interactions as well. 

  
My story is a slow burn, and I feel like every week (I upload on the weekends) people are complaining that there hasn't been a kiss yet. It really irks me! I've also managed to get a few commenters every week that seem to pick out the few lines in the story that are like literally SO vaguely erotic, and comment some really explicit responses to it. I've started getting DM's on Tumblr sending me NSFW text posts about the characters I'm writing about, and some of my readers and regular commenters have started sending me /their/ writing which is nice and flattering that they want me to see it, but I think the tipping point to this was getting a NSFW poem sent to me this morning. I cannot stress this enough- there's been NO SEX in my fic thus far- so it's making me feel really sad that that seems to be the only thing people are taking away from my work and/or looking forward to about it? I don't know if any of this makes sense but its got me down in the dumps.   


\^Also today, I had a commenter (who has been sending me posts on Tumblr unprompted) asked if I wanted a beta last week, to which I said no- only because I wanted to trust my own voice regarding my plotting/characterization on this WIP. I do the best I can with editing everything else- and I think I'm doing a decent job. I reread everything meticulously before I post, and each chapter goes through major revisions before they go up. I reread my posted chapters every few days and correct anything I see. Anyways- the commenter this week made a sort of backhanded mention of my grammar which is just. Really discouraging.

I’m looking for a specific fan fiction from the Artemis Fowl series. I only remember vague snippets and no direct quotes which has made searching really hard. A little bit of context: I was really into fan fiction back around 2012-ish but when I wanted more content sometimes I would go through older fics so it could have pretty much been from any time before then. All the stories I read contained Artemis Fowl and Holly Short to some capacity and I read a lot of fics shipping them but but occasionally read about them platonically. So I am not sure if this fic was shipping but I feel like it wasn’t. At the height of my obsession I didn’t know that AO3 even existed so I’m 99% sure I read this on FFnet.

I don’t remember the conflict of the story but the solution was for Artemis, Holly, and Butler to jump off a plane over a mountain and get teleported to some strange place where they were put through different challenges. I think when entering this place/plane they are separated and upon regrouping we find out Holly has lost her magic. I remember one task was for them to get on a boat that had a couple humans on it, the tasks were for fairies so trusting humans is hard for them. There’s some point where Butler is carrying Artemis and Holly (who are unconscious, likely due to the previous task) through a dessert, when Holly wakes up he puts her down and she sees her footprints are bloody from the burning of the sand. Butler reassures her the bleeding will stop eventually, I think he’s upset at her during this scene for a reason I can’t recall. Later on Butler dies. At some point after that Artemis and Holly get cornered by creatures(?), they throw their meager food supplies at them as a distraction and have to dive underwater to swim away. When they emerge on the other side one of Holly’s eyes has been gored out by one of them (to fully escape I think they climb a ladder out of that cave(?) area). Later Holly dies by falling down a cliff, there’s a bit where either Artemis or the narrator describes her body breaking on the rocks on the way down. Artemis survives the challenges and somehow gets back to reality and I think both Butler and Holly are alive back in their normal plane of existence when he does so. Maybe because he succeeded? Or because death was simply the way out of that plane? I remember it being fairly long and I believe it was completed. I am not 100% certain, because I don’t really remember an ending but to be fair I don’t remember the beginning either.

For all I know maybe this isn’t even just from one story, like I said, I read a lot of fan fiction and could have accidentally combined a few together in my memory as years passed. I remember enjoying the story hence why I’m looking for it but acknowledge that this is a long shot.

Since I've been wanting to emphasise the creeping tension (and pining too!) between the two characters, I've been thinking of doing this approach. 

Pro is that I get to really delve into the scene with each chapter, since I've been trying to improve on writing atmosphere and setting the tone more.

The con is that it's been a while since I've written a fic like this (only posted a one shot) so I'm nervous on how this'll go.

I wanted some second opinions since my brother wanted to use the Juggernaut armor since it seemed to him to be underutilized in fanfiction

Most all instances of arcane warrior wardens used the Ancient Elven Armor

But there is the problem of the armor being, you know, absolutely massive

Real armor was no where near that big, even the heaviest real historical armor was very slim and didn't restrict movement all that much

My brother's idea was that the Tevinter general the armor was forged for was the son of a magister and an elven slave, and that when he was killed by his subordinates for the armor that it was more of an issue regarding his heritage

(I know this is a potential spoiler, but I wanted a second opinion on this idea as it seems a bit sketchy to me)

That would solve the issue of the armor not being able to fit an elven build, but also there's the issue of the armor looking exactly the same as Ferelden armor

The fic takes place in NYC, the place I live, and I wanted to rework the character to be someone I feel I could realistically know in the city, so I made her a Black woman from Harlem. So far in the fic it's established that she's from Harlem, the daughter of a single father, and low-income. I want her to be authentic to the black women I actually know (I'm black myself) and that involves uses accurate AAVE, or what a lot of people know as 'ebonics'. (Not all the time, she would have the capability to code switch like a lot of POC do.)

She speaks plainly, but I really would like to incorporate some slang into her speech, much like an accent, but as someone who speaks AAVE and has grown up around it all my life, I don't know how it would be received by readers unfamiliar with the culture.

Calling oneself a 'bad b\*tch', using slang like 'deadass', or speaking in what is typically known as 'bad grammar' (ie saying 'You ain't go no money on you?' as opposed to saying 'You don't have any money on you?') are all characteristics of AAVE that people may look down on, or not like. But it's authentic to my culture, and endearing to me. AAVE means a lot to me, but I don't know how it'll be received. 

I hardly see reflections of New Yorkers like me and my community (or communities like mine like Harlem, the Bronx, deep Brooklyn) represented, especially in the MCU, and I want to change that a bit. Besides her, the fic is populated by the (majority white) canon characters.

Okay this might be a weird request for help but here we go :)

I was never too interested into getting into the hp fandom. I think it's mainly because I greatly enjoy romance fics and the idea of shipping any of the hp characters has always just felt kinda... off to me. Maybe because my entire childhood is at stake here lol.

Long story short I recently stumbled on a fic that was discussed in one of the threads on this lovely subreddit. The excerpt posted there was frankly hilarious so I gave it a shot. It's an explicit Fred/George/Hermione oneshot. (aaah, I *know*, right??)

Turns out it was insanely well written and reminded me that skilled authors can kinda pull anything off. It was a very entertaining read, loved it frankly!

So now, lovely folks of this subreddit: Please help me dip a toe into the fandom. It's huuuuge and dated and I have no idea what I might like. Of course, I checked out the author's other works, but the rest of the ships seemed so ""aaagh idk about that"" to me I didn't try them. Especially since I generally prefer mm slash fiction over het ships. 

Here are some preferences that are a must for me:
- well fucking written. Pleaaase, no epithets, no cringe metaphors, no excessive descriptions to blow up wordcount etc. Gimme something to be jealous of as a writer! :))
- Give me something mature. And I don't necessarily mean the rating, I mean the general vibe of the fic and how the characters respond to problems and how they interact with each other. 
- anything over 10k
- 3rd person POV

Some nice to haves:
- Angst (I'm all here for the pain baby)
- I also love a nice au here and there
- Charcters in their 20s or 30s
- Well written (!) smut
- m/m pairing
- occasional humor
- 80k plus longfics (or gimme that one 200k+ fic that tore your heart to shreds at 3am haha)

What I don't like / won't read (no bashing here, you do you!)
- rape / noncon
- incest
- underage
- first or second person POV 
- OC as mainchar / reader or self inserts

&gt; _We love flattery, especially shameless flattery, and we hate criticism, especially constructive criticism._

Archive of Our Own is a wonderful site, but like all other sites allowing comments, there is the potential for harassment.

Harassment can be utterly horrible, but there is a very simple fix: disallow comments (this goes on many other websites: Twitter and Tumblr both has ways to disallow interaction with varying precision.)

But that is a pickle: we want comments for the warm fuzzies of user engagement. Often we allow comments in the hopes people will love our stuff.

Harassing commentary can be reported, sure, but moderation takes time. So, what do?

Archive of Our Own has the most brilliant feature; a golden middle-way between ""no comments at all"" and ""open debate.""

It's called **Turn on comment moderation**. It's a tick-box when you upload or edit a work. (There's also a **Allow guest comments** you might consider.)

_What does it do?_

Comment moderation means you get to decide what comments show up under your work. You will be prompted with a button on each comment in your inbox, whether to publish the comment.

By _definition,_ it gives you the final word.

_How do I use it?_

Trolls and haters feed off engagement. ""Don't feed the trolls"" is a saying for a reason. The quickest way to make that shit stop in its tracks is to not engage.

Normally that is difficult to enforce with an open comment track: you can be as responsible as you like, but if any one of your readers feel like arguing with the trolls, you will be party to the discussion without consent.

By deleting derisive comments before they even see the light of day, you can prevent the problem before it even starts.

_That sounds nice and all, but it still hurts to receive hate._

It does. But this is where you must adopt a mindset.

Read your comments. When you find out it's hate, stop. Think: _ew, hate._  Take a step back. Suppress your urge to read it through and counter-argue. That's what they want.

If it's short, whatever. Delete it. Whoever sent you that was half-hearted in their distaste anyway. Laugh a little at how they can't even muster the energy to properly hate you.

If it's _long_, oh boy. Delete it. Feel _schadenfreude_. That asshole just spent who knows how long typing out a wall of text, and now all their hard work has gone up in smoke. Laugh a little at the image of some seething asshole, frothing at the mouth, your work whipping them into eye-watering rage, and impotently trying to get you to give them one iota of your attention.

No matter how hurtful, their comment will never see the light of day, and you will forget it ten minutes hence.

Stay safe, don't feed the trolls, and turn on comment moderation. (Turn off guest comments if you start getting flooded by anonymous randos.) Haters are a waste of oxygen, hate is a waste of internet bandwidth; treat it as such. _Ew, hate._

PS. The best part is when the trolls whine that comment moderation means you're a coward who won't debate them.

I made a worksin to fix this for my own works and make them all more book-like ([https://gist.github.com/cosysocks/eebe0c1d3650befc338dfb9dad535617](https://gist.github.com/cosysocks/eebe0c1d3650befc338dfb9dad535617) if you want to see the css) but I wonder if this could be a potential turn off for some readers.

I know that some people find it easier to read with gaps, and while anyone can disable the creator's workskin I worry there are people who see how it looks and don't give it a chance. Ao3 doesn't use print media so is a more default internet style appropriate? I also have a workskin for a specific fandom that makes the font serif and adds a few other things to make it look like the book's layout (e.g. an image for an hr tag) and I wonder if that (especially the serif font) makes things even worse.

Any thoughts are appreciated. I'm quite proud of this skin (the next sibling selector means I don't have to add a class to every p tag I want indented!), I do like how it looks and I haven't received any complaints (small fandom though), but I do worry I'm turning away potential readers or am even making it inaccessible for some.",True,False,False,FanFiction,t5_2r5kb,256993,public,self,Is a book style workskin worth it?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/t503fu/is_a_book_style_workskin_worth_it/,all_ads,6,,,,self,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'OAXSl8SY6T3JK9MGQyKxkoYbqZ71HQRYXLeB8CV0NXg', 'resolutions': [{'height': 54, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/4-DxLM-C2Ve3tHmVL5ITI6GRtMVG8PzzdBuCKiaabfE.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5811c5bda5fece1040636a6af8702ba790f0fd4', 'width': 108}, {'height': 108, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/4-DxLM-C2Ve3tHmVL5ITI6GRtMVG8PzzdBuCKiaabfE.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eee576fd4da7535eb53ceb88dd8b52f073048441', 'width': 216}, {'height': 160, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/4-DxLM-C2Ve3tHmVL5ITI6GRtMVG8PzzdBuCKiaabfE.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72872d880460efa723918c000adca0ed259cf775', 'width': 320}, {'height': 320, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/4-DxLM-C2Ve3tHmVL5ITI6GRtMVG8PzzdBuCKiaabfE.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f3545b9335d763c9da9c16bf7bf9a3f907dbd6f6', 'width': 640}, {'height': 480, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/4-DxLM-C2Ve3tHmVL5ITI6GRtMVG8PzzdBuCKiaabfE.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d241ace0f1c07088fac3f8469dbad3b05d2d419', 'width': 960}, {'height': 540, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/4-DxLM-C2Ve3tHmVL5ITI6GRtMVG8PzzdBuCKiaabfE.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9055f11bdc00beb0b3589e1cae5817d6070d83bc', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 640, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/4-DxLM-C2Ve3tHmVL5ITI6GRtMVG8PzzdBuCKiaabfE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=079a7260ec149880c73263d64811698adb22760a', 'width': 1280}, 'variants': {}}]}",,,,,,,

We're very happy to say that we are starting to bring on a bunch of new moderators! The sub has grown at a rapid pace over the last two years, and so has the need for a larger mod team. We will be bringing on the new mods in small groups over the next few months but we have the first group starting on the subreddit today - a massive welcome to [u/Blue-Jay27](https://www.reddit.com/user/Blue-Jay27), [u/PhoenixQueenAzula](https://www.reddit.com/u/PhoenixQueenAzula/), [u/UchihaCrow-](https://www.reddit.com/user/UchihaCrow-) and [u/frozenfountain](https://www.reddit.com/user/frozenfountain)!!!

Hullo! I'm Blu, I've been part of the sub for a couple of years and I'm delighted to join as a mod. I've been reading fanfiction for the past six years, and writing it for the past five. I jump between fandoms a lot, but my current obsessions are Marvel, My Hero Academia, and Harry Potter. I also really like analysis and meta, so feel free to ramble to me about headcanons and theories! World-building is my lifeblood. 

 ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ 

Hi all! You can call me Froze. I've been a part of the sub for just coming up on a year now, and weaving in and out of the fanfic world since way back in the halcyon days of LiveJournal. I currently write for Final Fantasy VII and I'm a fan of character studies, poetic prose, and the endless variations different people can create on the same characters. Joining this community has been a wonderful opportunity to share knowledge and broaden my mind, and I'm glad to have a chance to help out here, so thanks to the team for having me! 

 ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ 

Hi, I'm PhoenixQueenAzula! I am 21+ and in the US. I'm a big fanfiction enthusiast, it's been my hobby for many years. I both write and read, and am passionate about having spaces such as this one where we can all support eachother and share our accomplishments! Some of you may have already seen me around, I just think this is a great community and wanted to help keep it that way. 

 ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ 

Heya, I'm UchihaCrow or Crow for short. I'm mostly in the Naruto and Bungou Stray Dogs fandoms. I tend to read a lot of fandom-blind stuff and am always on the lookout for good recs. I've been on this subreddit for a little over a year, and it's my favourite online spot. I look forward to contributing as a mod! :) 

 ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ 

You may see some more mods floating in as we get settled in with numbers.

I don't interact with crossover fics as much, they've just never really popped up on my radar, so I wanted to ask people who are more familiar with them: would it be alright to take the plot of the movie and insert characters from another fandom? Of course I wouldn't be re-writing it line for line, and some major points would have to change, but I really liked the general direction the movie went in and wanted to keep that. I wouldn't normally ask this question since the movie is a rather point for point heist film, but it still has a recognizable series of events that I wouldn't want to claim as my own.

one time i wrote about a controversial pairing from some cartoon, and people started arguing with each other in the comments, to the point where the comments became angry walls of text. i orphaned it because i feared getting a call out post for that fic and i just didn't want it to be associated with me anymore. another time was when i *commented* on someone's dark fic, telling them i enjoyed it, and turns out the author was being stalked by a certain site and they exposed everyone who commented positively on their fics on that site, including myself. that site was known for really bad stuff so i changed my username and moved to a new account, and because of my anxiety disorder i'm still worried they're still stalking me.

However, I was thinking about doing something different from my norm and instead writing a story within the world of the series yet also completely different. So that got me thinking: how do you all feel about fanfics which are very loosely connected to the series itself? 

It’s because my idea was that it would have concepts and such from Dragon Ball, maybe even just a few characters in the form of only the gods, and things like that. But it would be it’s own story with a completely new cast for people to read and learn about. 

So ultimately, I just wanted to know everybody’s general stance on fics like that.

How annoyed would you be if someone told you your ship is shameful?

Rambling wall of text ahead, for those with time in their hands: so, I recently got into a tiny, tiny ship—it's more of a lifeboat, really—and went scouring the Archive for some reading material. As expected, food is scarce but there are a few crumbs here and there. 

I'm excited as I open the most recent one and hop onto the comments to see what everyone else thought before reading on, as I normally do. 

There's the usual praise, an expectant comment or two, some gushing, and then there it is: the elusive self-important, gatekeeping fan in all of their (in)gloriousness.

Now, this is a fandom with two different canon 'verses—one fairly recent, the other a decade-plua old and more established. Think along the lines of Marvel Comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 

Cool. That's more material for everyone; more variety, more options. A chance to explore old characters in a new setting, in new relationships. This is a good thing, right?

Wrong! At least in this person's eyes. 

See, this person doesn't agree. They're foaming at the mouth as they're typing out their comment, telling the author there's no way these two characters would ever have a romantic or sexual relationship in the original 'verse. They say, and I quote, it's 'such a darn shame' that these two characters are being shipped with this new release, ruining what they originally had.

They're adamant one character is a parent figure to the other; there is no way something romantic would ever happen between them in the original material. 

Now, here I am in all my 17 years of participating in fandom, reading this comment and thinking, *man, this person really shouldn't peek behind the curtains of the likes of Supernatural,* where arguably the biggest ship is an incestuous one. Sam and Dean are brothers—literally, not figuratively—and they're banging each other on every available surface every other fic.

Hell, if you dig deep enough—and not even *that* deep—you'll find plenty of parent/child incest in there as well, and there's nothing figurative about those relationships.

Of course, none of that would *ever* happen in the source material. We *are* talking about the CW here, not HBO. 

But people like what they like, and they'll write what they wanna write.

Some of it—a lot, even—is not my personal cup of tea. Should I go around telling authors how unrealistic or improbable their ship is? Is it really that abominable that someone would dare to ship two characters who are simply friends, or family, or have never even met in the source material?

No, I shouldn't, and no, it isn't. The best part of fandom is being able to expand on the original. Isn't that the entire point? 

But this person is on a mission. They've copy-pasted their comment in every. single. fic set in the new universe.

I'm sitting here admiring the authors' patience and self-restraint in replying to this person's judgemental musings. They're better people than I could ever be. Bless them.

Have you had the displeasure of receiving such a comment? Do you take the time to reply, or do you simply delete and move on?

Personally, I've never had it happen. But I'm now apprehensive about writing in this fandom because I *know* this person is perched over their keyboard, waiting with bated breath to Ctrl-V their word vomit into my comment section.

I'm really just saying this to make it clear that this is a fic I wrote for myself. I didn't expect anyone to read it. However, I actually got a comment some time ago, of someone who'd read the series and was just as excited as me to find someone who also knew it. Naturally I was really happy and we started just discussing the series in the comments. We're basically writing letters to each other in the comments just talking about the books and it's really great but i feel bad like I'm tricking my nonexistent readers to click on the story because there are lots of comments.

I really don't want to stop having these discussions, but at the same time I feel bad continuing like that. I don't really want to move to a social media site for multiple reasons and I mean I can't really post my e mail address in a public comment section. Anyone have ideas on what to do?

One really stood out to me and I've re-read it 3 times already. The fic was left incomplete and hasn't been updated in many years. Luckily it didn't end in a cliffhanger so it's not super heartbreaking.

Anyway I've had an idea for a story and I'm really enjoying planning it out and writing it has cured a two-year writers block. It's similar to this amazing story I read in premise (arranged marriage) and genre/tone. I think it's a fresh take on the idea though, however its also the same pairing as this other fic and there aren't lots with those tags so I'm nervous people might compare the two.

I'm not sure if I should tag it as inspired by as they are similar and the writer of the original is so talented. However they're set in completely different universes with different story beats so I'm not sure if its necessary. Plus the original author has been completely MIA for three years so I couldn't even ask. Plus plus I don't want fans of that story to come to my story expecting an ending to the incomplete story because I think that would be really disrespectful.

First off, I want to say THANK YOU to all the commenters on [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/t37ptr/star_vs_the_forces_of_evil_is_my_premise/). 

Thank you u/A_Cow_in_Space, u/jellydrizzle, u/W33B_N3M0, u/Rinpoo, and u/Trilobyte141 for believing in my premise and giving me the confidence to continue it. I was really nervous that people (especially fans) would laugh at my idea for wanting to do something so childish to the main character, but I'm happy that wasn't the case.

Anyway...

Now that I'm confident enough to start it, I would like to ask for a critique on a crucial scene, one I already have mapped out in my head.

It's Marco's first meeting with his mentor.

Here's the full scene:

Marco has been lost in a forest dimension for several days, chasing after a Hekapoo clone. He barely manages to fight off and escape a pack of demonic wolf creatures, receiving a huge clawed gash on his chest, slashes on his back, and deep bites on his left arm and leg. On top of that, he ate some berries to rehydrate himself that turned out to be poisonous, giving him stomach pains and hallucinations. He ends up hallucinating the Hekapoo clone and ends up chasing it off a cliff. He lands on several trees and is pretty badly scratched up.

This is the point where he gives up and cries for his parents, since he's too sick and injuried to get up or move. He passes out as a figure approaches him, faintly asking if it's his mom.

Marco wakes up on a couch in a cozy living room, next to a warm fireplace. His body is tired, but better and his wounds have been dressed and treated. The mentor, a goat woman in her mid-to-late 40s, walks in with a tray of food, happy to see him awake. She introduced herself as (this is a placeholder name until I can come up with a real one) Tara. Marco is confused and Tara explains that he was dying and that she found him while hunting, brought him home, bandaged his wounds, and gave him some medicine for the poison. She tells him that he needs to eat and rest.

Marco looks down and realizes, to his embarrassment, that he's only wearing his underwear under the robe. Tara calmly explains (and apologizes) that she had to strip him to treat his wounds. The robe is hers, she wrapped him in it for the sake of modesty. She pulls out his clothes and shoes from under the tray, having been repaired, stitched up, and washed by her. She encourages him to eat, sampling some of the food and tea herself to show him it's not poison or anything.

Marco does and Tara asks who he is and Marco, now calming down and starting to trust her, introduces himself. She's suprised to learn that he's a human, having thought him for a Mewman. She asks what he's doing out here and Marco tells her about his quest.

Tara asks what he's going to do now and Marco says that he wants to get back to his quest, but admits to being a bit in over his head and nervous about what lies ahead. Being a hunter/gatherer/craftswoman, Tara offers to teach him some survival skills in order to help him. Before Marco can answer, he suddenly feels the need to relieve himself (Tara jokingly stating that's the medicine flushing out the poison) and Tara points him to the bathroom. While in there, he looks over himself in the sink mirror, noting the frail state of his body and the numerous bandages and wounds covering him. Realizing just how much he needs this help, he goes out and tells Tara that he'll take the training.

Again, the scene above is just the concept form. I haven't written it or even planned out all the dialogue yet. It's just the general direction I want it to go in. Rewrites and revisions will happen.

The reason I'm here is because I'm a bit concerned that the idea of Marco being stripped to his underwear by a woman he doesn't know while unconscious would be creepy or unsettling to some. I'm trying to write it as innocent, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

Hello everyone, we’re back again for another monthly prompt! We like to do stuff to celebrate crossovers for Multi-Fandom March (Yes, that's a thing! ...Since a few years ago when the mods made it up). Since it was a fun thread last year, this month we’re bringing it back for the monthly challenge and creating crossover prompts for ourselves!

Credit for this idea goes to u/kilogram666, who originally posted this on the sub a while back [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/doxfrw/i_have_a_challenge_for_you/). You can check this thread out for an example of what to do if my explanation confuses you, haha.

The rules are very simple!

* Post a list of your fandoms as a new comment. 
* Make sure they’re fandoms you’re comfortable writing for, because the next step is…
* Another user will come and suggest two fandoms from the list you posted to make a crossover fic out of!
* For example, if I list my fandoms as Naruto, Avatar: the Last Airbender, and Fire Emblem: Three Houses, another user might come along and say “Naruto and Avatar”, and I have to try to come up with a crossover of those two fandoms!
* Go and leave suggestions on another user’s comment! Even if they already have some replies! More options is always good. Feel free to help people brainstorm if you like!
* You *don’t* have to write for every prompt you receive. However, if you want to try your hands at more than one, go nuts!
* If you want to merge the prompts you get together for a mega crossover, that's okay! Just make sure to note that you were given the prompts as ""X &amp; Y"" and ""X &amp; Z"" fandoms! :D

**Minimum word count:** 1000 words    
**Maximum word count:** No maximum for this month!

Submitted fics also do *not* have to be complete, because I know crossovers can be complicated beasties, but make your best effort, okay? XD 

* A posting thread will go up in the last days of the month.
* Feel free to post your completed fics to AO3 or FFN (or wherever else you like!) before the posting thread is up, but don’t go linking them on r/FanFiction until the posting thread is up – since we all want to get an equal chance and reading up on your works.
* Do feel free to sneakily PM your fics to the user who prompted you though ;) 
* All participating fics will be collected in a showcase that'll be up for the entire month of April here on the sub – there will also be an AO3 collection where you can add your fics!

Problem is, there are a lot of adaptions -musical, unofficial sequel, films, etc.- that are really popular, I would say even more so, but I despise them. Like, really. And sadly, most fics are inspired by those adaptions rather than the book I love.

Which means that sometimes, when I click on the fic, I know the other inspirations are there, but I don't know to which degree, and it really pulls me out of the reading when it's too much.

For example, the main character is blonde, but since in several films and such she's brune, in fanfics she's also brune.

So I would say that more than half of the fics aren't on the content I like, but are mixed with it.

2. '*Fighter*', because not only is it the title to the song that (in my opinion) best fits the ship in the fic, the fic also relates to not only the mood of the song, but also what it's about. Even without the context of the song, the word ""Fighter"" is still a great word to sum up what the fic is about and moreso the conclusion.

But I finally got my outline finished, and it's so perfect, and just, *chef's kiss*. Ugh.

Anyways I've been working so hard on the drafts of the first chapters, been making an effort to exert some self control and not jump ahead to the really exciting plots that I already have ready to go in my mind. I have horrible self control though, so I made a little cheat page where I can write little blurbs to use in later chapters, and something brilliant just sparked in me this morning, and I started writing part of the big climax at the end, and-

Just thought of this possibility, wanted to ask around.

I love to visualize what is happening in my stories and would love to have it seen in live action or comic form on-screen. 

Problem - I suck at drawing, so drawing the stories in comic style is impossible. 

My solution has been to use screenshots from the original material and insert speech balloons and stuff to make it a comic of my fic. 

Till now, I have been using these only for myself, as a sort of prompt. But would these be publishable on AO3?

 For example, if I have a one-shot which is doing reasonably well, can I use screenshots to have it 'acted out' and add it as another fic related to the first one - or as a new chapter to the first one? Would this count as fan art/ fan fic? 

There's nothing explicit involved, just actions that could occur in the original show.

I noticed one odd thing, though. I went to deactivate my account, and on my profile, it showed I had one story. This story was last updated the day I created my account and was written in Russian. I did not create this story

I immediately deactivated the account, secured passwords on the Twitter account I user to create my Ficbook username. Does anyone know what might of happened? Could the username have existed in the past, and somehow an old story was linked to my account? I'm obviously nervous someone got my info, so I'm trying to figure out what might have happened.

Please, recommend to me your fave completed, 80k +fics with high stakes and tensions in the story!

I need a gripping, emotional, page-turner story!

**WANT:**

* *Well Written*
* good characterization, no OOC
* world-building
* I lose interest REALLY fast if the writer keeps telling me rather than show me what is going on.
* Smart/competent MC
* high stakes! good plot.
* Happy ending

**DO NOT WANT:**

**I do not want a comedy, parody or crack.**

**I do not want:**

* Omegaverse (or similar), nor the tension/angst/stakes coming from any kind of sexual abuse (or fear of it).
* No First Person POV.
* No love triangle.
* No misunderstandings that can easily be resolved with communication.
* No Major Character Death (permanent?) no sad/tragic ending.
* NO WIPs
* NO SI/OC/Isekai/reader/Y/N
* No Genderbender
* Doesn't use/overuse terms to describe each characters like: "" the brunette"" , ""the older men"", ""*avada kedavra green eyes""* , ""the chocolate colored girl"". etc.
* I would rather avoid any ""Coffee Shop AU' I prefer canon settings, but if it fits, I WILL READ.

I'm willing to broaden my horizons! so if you know a ship/fandom that based on my faves you think I would like, please tell me.

I will only read on AO3 and FFN

P.S: Destiel/Drarry are not on my list, I think I already read ALL OF IT. and I need a break!

Thank you u/A_Cow_in_Space, u/jellydrizzle, u/W33B_N3M0, u/Rinpoo, and u/Trilobyte141 for believing in my premise and giving me the confidence to continue it. I was really nervous that people (especially fans) would laugh at my idea for wanting to do something so childish to the main character, but I'm happy that wasn't the case.

Anyway...

Now that I'm confident enough to start it, I would like to ask for a critique on a crucial scene, one I already had planned out in my head.

It's Marco's first meeting with his mentor.

Here's the full scene:

*Marco has been lost in a forest dimension for several days, chasing after a Hekapoo clone. He barely manages to fight off and escape a pack of demonic wolf creatures, receiving a huge clawed gash on his chest, slashes on his back, and deep bites on his left arm and leg. On top of that, he ate some berries to rehydrate himself that turned out to be poisonous, giving him stomach pains and hallucinations. He ends up hallucinating the Hekapoo clone and ends up chasing it off a cliff. He lands on several trees and is pretty badly scratched up.* 

*This is the point where he gives up and cries for his parents, since he's too sick and injuried to get up or move. He passes out as a figure approaches him, faintly asking if it's his mom.*

*Marco wakes up on a couch in a cozy living room, next to a warm fireplace. His body is tired, but better and his wounds have been dressed and treated. The mentor, a goat woman in her mid-to-late 40s, walks in with a tray of food, happy to see him awake. She introduced herself as (this is a placeholder name until I can come up with a real one) Tara. Marco is confused and Tara explains that he was dying and that she found him while hunting, brought him home, bandaged his wounds, and gave him some medicine for the poison. She tells him that he needs to eat and rest.*

*Marco looks down and realizes, to his embarrassment, that he's only wearing his underwear under the robe. Tara calmly explains (and apologizes) that she had to strip him to treat his wounds. The robe is hers, she wrapped him in it for the sake of modesty. She reveals his clothes from under the tray, having been repaired and washed by her. She encourages him to eat, sampling some of the food and tea herself to show him it's not poison or anything.*

*Marco does and Tara asks who he is and Marco, now calming down and starting to trust her, introduces himself. She's suprised to learn that he's a human, having thought him for a Mewman. She asks what he's doing out here and Marco tells her about his quest.* 

*Tara asks what he's going to do now and Marco says that he wants to get back to his quest, but admits to being a bit in over his head and nervous about what lies ahead. Being a hunter/gatherer/craftswoman, Tara offers to teach him some survival skills in order to help him. Before Marco can answer, he suddenly feels the need to relieve himself (Tara jokingly stating that's the medicine flushing out the poison) and Tara points him to the bathroom. While in there, he looks over himself in the sink mirror, noting the frail state of his body and the numerous bandages and wounds covering him. Realizing just how much he needs this help, he goes out and tells Tara that he'll take the training.*

Again, the scene above is just the concept form. I haven't written it or even planned out all the dialogue yet. It's how I want it to go.

The reason I'm here is because I'm a bit concerned that the idea of a 14-year-old boy being stripped to his underwear by a woman he doesn't know while unconscious would be creepy or unsettling to some. I'm trying to write it as innocent, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.

it's a huge fandom (xx,xxx fics) and i had figured that, with so many fans, there would probably be at least a little chunk who would be interested in the rarepair. but, their fics make up less than 1% of all fics for the fandom with very sparse updates. i'm obviously biased, but i don't understand why they're not more popular. they aren't problematic and i think they have a lot of potential. some of the most popular ships in the fandom aren't canon, so i don't think that's an issue... 

anyways, i've been writing and posting anyway, initially accepting and being okay with not getting nearly as many views/comments as the more popular ships. 

but it's SO hard not to compare, especially when i see other authors getting hundreds of kudos per fic and people commenting/sharing on other sites over and over how much they adore their work and how brilliant they are. i want to be happy for them but i can't help being jealous, especially when i read some of these other fics and feel like they're ""not as good"" as mine. 

i feel like an awful person for thinking like that because i don't want to minimize someone else's work or the effort/love they put into it. but i do feel like some of these fics aren't as well-written or creative as mine. yet they're getting hundreds of comments when i get zero. and i feel like such a narcissist for saying that. i don't think i'm a genius or anything.  it's not that i want others to get less comments/attention, but i wish i could get at least some too. 

and i know ofc it makes sense for the more popular ships to have more traffic. but god it still stings so much, especially when i am used to writing fic for popular ships on other shows and getting a good amount of comments/kudos. i'm so used to knowing for certain that my fics moved people, and i'm so used to the gratification of knowing all the work/thought i put into a fic was appreciated by someone out there. 

it really stings because i love this rarepair SO much and i feel like i'm putting more heart, soul, and creative power into writing them than i have for any other ship, and yet my work is getting less acknowledgement than ever before. and it just sucks feeling like i'm currently writing my best works and no one else is able to enjoy/appreciate them. 

i AM writing primarily for myself, and i'm going to keep writing and keep giving myself credit. it's just so lonely and i don't know how to stop comparing. i'm a part of the social media community for the fandom so i can't just stay away from the other ship tags because i see these fics being praised everywhere.

there are definitely people who like the rarepair, but not enough to read fics for the ship. so i wonder if i should try and write something that's more appealing to a new/potential audience to reel them in. but i'm not sure if that's an unhealthy motivation for writing and i don't know how i would go about it.

I've lost a fanfic about How Thranduil is fostered by a woman in a different dimension, gets sent back to middle earth, then she gets sent to middle earth after its been a few hundred years fir Thranduil, he recognizes her and its really cute and fluffy and shit.

in more detail:

The first chapter is about a modern woman who fosters people from different worlds/dimensions till they can return. She fosters child Thranduil bc there's some war going on. She works at a university? She tells others that he is French and that his parents left him with her for a little while. He likes to draw her stuff. They have their own little lullaby and its super cute and all. They get super close, but eventually the time comes that he must return to his world. She sings her lullaby to him and im pretty sure he promises to not forget her. 

In the second chapter she gets send to middle earth? Its been hundreds of years for thranduil but only a few for her? I can’t remember exactly where she is in the timeline now, but im pretty sure its the fellowship now.   She gets found by them (in the forest?) and gets brought along with them back to Mirkwood. Im pretty sure Gimli tells her to shut up bc she won’t stop singing the lullaby. She gets taken in with the rest of them and she has audience with thranduil. He’s now all icy and his typical brooding vibe. He heard her humming and remembers that he had a mother figure a long time ago and that she is said woman. He kinda bursts out into tears idk

I don’t think there were more than two chapters

They wondered where he might be. Then Matt remembered something. The man disappeared after Matt and Linda had been at the castle. It was possible for the teacher to get lost in time. Linda asked the boy to speak quietly as someone could hear them. Suddenly a math teacher entered the classroom. It was a thin and unpleasant person. He ordered everyone to shut up and sit at the desks. The students just grumbled. The lessons of this teacher were the most boring and no one liked to attend them. But there was no choice. Only after school Matt and Linda were able to discuss the topic that interested them so much.

I'm looking for fanfic recs from any media but preferably with these elements:

* Easy to understand, even without any knowledge of canon (things like modern AUs would be good)
* 3k words at least, because I want something that resembles a book in length and plot structure so I can ease her into the change from fiction to fanfiction
* PLEASE nothing too explicit, this IS my teacher. I don't think she'll appreciate pwp lol
* preferably something from ao3, Wattpad and [ff.net](https://ff.net) are fine I guess, but I would prefer something from ao3 lol

Also!! As far as I know, she's fine with either slash or gen, she likes romance fiction enough to be fine with slash I think.

The circumstances are a little odd with this one. 

On one hand, the first part opens with the attempted suicide of another character, and he isn’t confirmed to survive until part 2. So I’m afraid if I tag MCD on part one, readers may think it’s him who dies.

On the other, she does die in canon, and her death in the fic is the same as it is in canon, so it isn’t something fans aren’t used to and it’s not supposed to be a surprise.

Still, I’m worried they may think this is an AU where she lives, as those aren’t uncommon and I’ve written one before.

I read fanfiction from time to time and I see (for example), this: ""the silver haired man (insert verb here)"" a lot for some reason. This sort of ambiguous description makes sense in small doses or when a character is still mysterious and unknown, but using surface level descriptions instead of a character's name is weird to me.
This being so common in fanfiction also makes me confused because if I am reading fanwork about a series I am familiar with, wouldn't I already know what a character's hair/eyes/age is like? I read a fic just now that was perfectly eloquent otherwise but they put ""the older male"" instead of ""Kakashi"" out of nowhere like the fact he was older and a ""male"" was significant in this situation. Sometimes it feels like the author is purposefully trying to use the character's actual name as little as they possibly can and for what? 
I simply do not know. I'm not sure if this bothers others the way it does me though.

""I will report you.""  
""You're not.  
You're just going to get it good.""  
""I will.""  
He pulled out his cock and stroked it gently.  
""When I feel your balls against my hand, I'll fucking do it.  
You know that.""  
""Yeah, you said that already.""  
I started playing with his balls.  
""God, Jason, I love your balls.  
They're so full and round.""  
I sank to my knees and sucked his balls into my mouth, up to the smooth taut skin on the underside with a few quick bobbing strokes of my head.  
I pulled his cock toward me and rolled it against my tongue.  
I moved back and forth between his balls and the head of his cock, licking it and teasing it with my lips and tongue.  
Jason had planted his hands on the cheeks of my ass and was pulling me into him, his cock grinding against my asscheeks.  
His balls rolled over my tongue as he grabbed hold of my hair and pulled my head away from his balls.  
When I reached his balls, he knotted his fingers in my hair and pushed his cock against my mouth.  
I decided to give him a good teachable moment.  
I let his cock slide from my lips and grabbed his hips with both hands.  
My fingers wrapped around his cockhead and I tilted my head to the side and let it fly.  
It hit the back wall of my throat and bounced off.  
I let him slide from my mouth and pulled my head away.  
""Oh, fuck, Scott!"" he shouted.  
""That was the prettiest fucking thing I've ever seen!""  
He hugged me against him and spun me around in his arms.  
I wrapped my arms around his waist and looked up at him.  
His dark eyes were glinting in the light from the floor lamp near the bed.  
""I'm glad you like it, Scott,"" he said.  
""You're not the only one who's glad.""  
Jason hugged me again and spun me around to face him.  
His hips shoved his cock into my ass and he moved me around some more, bobsledding me.  
We didn't fall over.  
""Lean back in that chair, Scott,"" he said.  
I did and my ass slid along his cock as he bounced me off his cock.  
I first felt his hands caressing my chest and licked them to taste his pre - cum.  
It was still bitter, but not as bad as it had been.  
His hands moved to my head and pulled my face into his cockhead.  
His cock was dripping on my lips and I sucked the entire shaft down my throat in one go.  
I was well trained and knew exactly what Jason liked.  
I kept my ass tilted at a slight angle and Jason pushed and pulled me up and down on his cock.  
I twisted my head and sucked as much of his cock into my throat as I could.  
I could feel it swelling and I knew he was getting close.  
My tongue laid against the underside of his cockhead and I played with it.  
Jason was moaning, now, and his hips were jerking.  
His cock was exploding and I was sucking for all I was worth.  
Black, male cum shot out of his cock and blasted down my throat.  
It was so powerful that at first I didn't even realize what I was feeling.  
I just knew that I loved Jason's cum and I loved making him cum.  
I kept sucking as he emptied his nuts into my mouth.  
The first shot made me gag, but the next two pulled me into a trance.  
I sucked and tasted his sweet, creamy cum.  
Jason's left hand held onto the back of my head.  
His right hand held onto my hair.  
I don't even know when his hips started moving.  
All I know is that I did what he wanted and sucked every drop of cum out of his cock.  
My own cock was blooming and I slipped under his arm and lifted my cock in front of his face.  
He didn't have to do anything except hold it and look at it.  
I got onto my knees and pushed my cock between his lips.  
His hand moved from my head to my cock and he held it there.  
I shoved my cock up into his mouth and I was trapped.  
Jason's right hand left my head and wrapped itself around his cock.  
He didn't suck it, though.  
He just held it there.  
I could feel his tongue at the back of my throat.  
He was sucking as hard as he could.  
My cock pushed into his throat and he opened his mouth and yelled, ""Fuck, Scott!  
Fuck!""  
His cock exploded with a massive tidal wave of cum that slammed into me and went right down my throat.  
He held onto my head and fed me his cum.  
I swallowed as much as I could right away so I could savour it, but much of it spilled onto my face and neck and shirt.  
More still squirted onto my chest as Jason struggled to contain his pleasure.  
He finally sighed and dropped his forehead to the back of my head.  
My hands left his ass and moved to his sides.  
My thumbs gently embraced the twelve inches of ebony man meat there.  
Jason strained away from me and I leaned back until he was again sitting on my face.  
His ass left my face and I heard a loud grunt as it cam back into place.  
Jason was bucking his hips now, his cock pulsating inside my mouth as he came in long bursts.  
He was getting bigger by the second and I loved it.  
I loved making him do that.  
He was quiet when he finally got control of himself and started to lift himself off my face.  
He lay down on the blanket and his left arm came around my shoulders.  
His right arm moved to my chest and held me close to him.  
My naked body was pressed into his from crotch to chest.  
My hardon was shoved into his pubes and my chest was pressed into his.  
His mouth found my left nipple and began to suck on it.  
Jason held me like that for a long time.  
Neither of us spoke.  
We didn't have to.  
Our body language told enough.  
His arm held me at my chest, the hand at my chest the other arm holding me at my back.  
My head rested against his right biceps.  
Jason slowly moved his mouth away from my nipple and turned his head to look at me.  
His hand left my chest and crept upward to my face.  
His fingers brushed my chin and turned my face left.  
His hand came back down to my chest as he looked at me again.  
I turned my face back to him and opened my mouth.  
His tongue flicked out and explored me again.  
His face drew closer to mine and his lips crushed against mine.  
His arms tightened around me and he pulled me into him.  
My lips parted and my tongue found his.  
His hand reached down to my crotch and grabbed hold of my cock.  
I was totally soft now and I turned my head to the side and let it fall out of my mouth.  
His cock fell to my chest and I could see it towering there, still dripping cum from Jason's orgasm.  
He stroked me gently a few times, the tips of his fingers tickling my chest and my stomach.  
And then he turned his head and did it again.  
And then again.  
I began to wonder if this wasn't some kind of test.  
Was he deciding if he really wanted to kiss me or not?  
He reached his hands up to my face once more and I turned to face him.  
I opened my mouth and his tongue found mine and pushed its way inside.  
His hands found my shoulders and he held me there, kissing me fully and deeply.  
I could feel his cock at my stomach and I sucked in my stomach as it slid over it.  
And then another drop of pre - cum appeared at the tip.  
It seemed to form a stream all the way up to his chin.  
Jason's tongue stroked and teased and poked at my cock.  
I could feel his nose in my pubes and his chin resting in the hair at the base of my cock.  
Even his nose was dirty.  
I didn't even know why, but I knew I liked it.  
He moaned softly, turning his head to the side and back again.  
His lips and tongue toyed with my cock.  
All the while he was still tonguing me, he was twirling one of his fingers around my right nipple.  
When his finger slipped over my tongue, I sucked in a deep breath.  
His mouth took hold of my cock again and he sucked as hard as he could.  
I could feel his throat working as he sucked air into his lungs through his nose.  
My cock jerked in his mouth and he pulled his head away.  
My cum cried out for his mouth and throat.  
He swallowed over and over again.  
I could feel his throat tightening around my cock.  
He pulled his mouth off my cock and sat back.  
My cock was partially soft now but still quite hard.  
He rubbed it on his face a few times and finally fed it to me.  
It was even bigger than I expected.  
Not really long, but bigger than most of my friends' cocks.  
No hair on top like the first time, and he had more around the base.  
It looked a lot like Rob's cock, but I found that hard to believe.  
I'd seen his cock in a wheelchair with Rob once.  
He was bigger than me, but I didn't think Rob was anywhere near as big as that.  
It was perfectly smooth.  
No hair on it at all.  
Just the perfectly round head.  
Rob's was hairless and perfectly smooth.  
I found myself wishing that I could see Jason's cock.

I'm a 23 M writer, aspiring to go professional one day. Just wanted to share my piece about writing content that I normally find off-putting or personally hurtful or frightening, and how it can be extremely therapeutic depending on the person.

Through my life, I was raised in a Christian household. My parents were far from extremists, raising me with the motto of ""make room at the table"". However, within my close family was also a great deal of mental illness and abuse, especially coming from the left leaning side of my family. The abuse was primarily mental and verbal, and all this combined with a natural sense of existential terror and depression ultimately led to me leaving the faith, and even attempting suicide. I won't get into tons of details, but I hope the gist can get across.

After coming out the other side of that mess, I started incorporating a lot of my depression, anger, and fears into my stories. At first, it was practically as a sense of self-harm; horribly hurting the characters I created as analogues of myself. But eventually, as I got healthier, I started looking at these subjects from a different perspective. I wanted to examine them more than revel in them. Pay respect to issues, incorporate my own experiences with them as well.

The main hero of my current longfic suffers from a form of PTSD very heavily inspired by a condition I have myself, and I feel very proud of being able to illustrate what it feels like for those who may not know about it. Another story I'm writing is all about existential terror and the power of faith for good and bad, something I've struggled with most of my life. I would cower in fear when the pastor spoke of death and the afterlife, but examining it from my own perspective feels... cathartic. Like a deep breath finally being let out.

I could go on more, but I've certainly gone on long enough. There are ways to discuss and illustrate one's issues in a healthy manner that provides greater understanding both for themselves and others. I'd encourage you guys to find those ways that genuinely help you. Glorifying or romanticizing issues rarely helps anything, trust me. But examining them, helping yourself and others understand them, can help you in more ways than you may know.

My opinion on this character isn't exactly unpopular, but it's not universal either and I want to be respectful to people who *do* like them. I'm definitely not planning to bash them intentionally, but I'm worried my feelings about this character are still going to be pretty obvious even if I do my best to write them in-character. 

Part of my issue with this character is that they do a lot of really irresponsible and shitty things, often with horrific consequences, and they're never really held accountable for it the way other character are, by the writers or characters. They're also given multiple big important ""save the day"" moments that don't really feel earned imo. Like the writers just wanted the character to get the glory for once since they're basically the one ""muggle"" character and their actual skills aren't all that glamorous, so they wrote these situations in a way that only this character can fix it just because it's their ""turn"" to be the hero. So I'm worried that  just writing this character doing the kind of shitty, irresponsible things they do in canon or even just referencing past shitty behavior and not making excuses for the character or ignoring the consequences of their actions in my writing could come across as character bashing. I also don't plan to give them any of these big hero moments and have them playing a supporting role in the story, which feels more realistic to me, given their abilities. 

Aside from that, I'm also just kind of worried that since I dislike this character, I'm pretty much looking at them through...whatever the opposite of rose-tinted glasses is (shit-tinted glasses?) and I won't be able to tell if I've exaggerated their flaws because their flaws are almost definitely exaggerated in my mind. Any advice on how to put myself in the shoes of someone who *is* a fan of this character to get a better idea of whether my portrayal is fair or not, short of having it beta-read by a fan? (I have my partner look over my writing from time to time, but he dislikes this character just as much as I do and thinks I should bash away.)

At this point I'm debating just cutting the character out entirely since my fic takes place several years post-canon, so it wouldn't necessarily be unrealistic for the characters to have drifted apart, but I was kind of going for a whole ""we need to get the gang back together"" sort of thing and this character's absence will definitely be noticed by readers.",True,False,False,FanFiction,t5_2r5kb,255898,public,self,Tips for writing characters you dislike without accidental character bashing?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/t3kztk/tips_for_writing_characters_you_dislike_without/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, in the original series, started with the main character getting chased by the villains. His brother barely gets any screen time and we never know him as well as other side characters. He was basically a prop that motivated the mc.

In my fanfic, I added a prologue scene where the main character and his brother show them growing up, and playing around with each other. Foreshadowing what kind of people they would become. There was one scene I added that showed the father’s connection to the villain group without outright stating it.

Im not saying I’m “fixing” a series, or saying “the original was terrible” cause the fanfic wouldn’t exist without it. I guess it comes from a place of admiration, wanting to see the original story you loved so much ironed out it’s kinks.

Heck, I’m not saying if what I did was actually good, just something I wanted to tryout.

I've been writing since I was 9, publsihed my first work on wattpad when I was 12, and since then I started writing fanfics

now I've only been on AO3 since april 2021, so of course I'm not ""huge""

and I'm grateful fro my 100+ hits on a few things (300+ on a marauders fic), but my hits to kudos are low, so my brain says I'ma  bad writer bc people read it but doesn't liek it

my only comment is because I wrote something in danish and I got invited to a prompt challenge

ofc a following takes time, I just feel like I'm lacking talent or something since no one seems to *like* it

I've written in a few popular fandoms (Harry potter and Criminal Minds) and some smaller ones (waterfire saga) so I doubt it's becasue of the lack of people wanting fics

my most popular fic has 300+ hits and 9 kudos (again, I feel like teh ratio is off), which is a marauder onehsot

it's gone to teh point I hardly write anymore because everytime I check AO3 (whoch is multiple times a day, I jsut need to) I get unmotivated

Yeah, decided to make a reddit post about this. A friend of mine found out that I like pairing up 'unethical' pairings—by that, including abusive pairings. Just to be clear, I don't condone it and would never want that to happen to me or anyone, but I never got the chance to tell that to them. Short context: They asked me if I supported this 'problematic' fictional pairing, and my response was similar to ""I don't mind if people shipped it as long as it's not harming anyone"",  if it was cut short.

I'm actually pretty fine if they are uncomfortable with it, yet I couldn't help but feel ashamed that they asked me a question whether I shipped this unethical pairing on a call with others I barely knew. I felt like I was backed into a corner.

I'm not so sure about turning this into a vent post, but I guess I'll explain some context again. I had to make excuses of leaving the call because I felt so uncomfortable that it was done in front of others. It didn't help that I felt some sort of disgust directed towards me and my head telling me that they would talk negatively about me to others. After all, if they did it to someone else, there's a chance they would do it to me too, right? 

It's not new that this particular friend of mine would express their discomfort of these ships in our chat, but I feel like I would've appreciated it if they talked to me privately than asking a question I didn't want to  answer in front of others I barely interacted. I just felt singled out??

So yeah, anyways, I feel ashamed about my ships that I tried working on overcoming these past few months- it went higher last night. It's funny how my confidence easily fell apart just because someone disapproved of it. I lost half of my sleeping hours feeling so stressed about what they would think of me, and whether they would talk behind my back to others. I can't assume so  much though. They did say that they were open to any opinions after I asked them if they were uncomfortable about what I said...

But it's hard for me to not doubt they wouldn't talk awfully about me. I've witnessed them participate in calling an acquitance of mine a thot, judging her for dating many people. Said acquitance is actually a nice person when I interacted with her. She has even helped me set up a date with someone else, and she's pretty sweet. But like yeah, that's where the doubt of me over them accepting to any opinions come in.

What if they go? ""Ew, this person ships this. So disgusting. I knew she was so weird."" Eesh, I can imagine my reputation getting fucked because of this person too. I felt so uncomfortable that I had to leave the group call. I don't think it's a good sign that they haven't talked to me in a day ever since last night too, so... Oh god.

But ugh, fuck. Why can't I just learn to care less about what others think...? Am I, in a way, overthinking? One of the voices in my head says yes, apparently. Any advice or experience to share? Maybe I'd feel less alone &lt;3",True,False,False,FanFiction,t5_2r5kb,255733,public,self,Ashamed for shipping a pairing?

Looking for fan fictions where the main plot is that the single teacher from a series finds romance with someone, whether it be another character in the series or an OC doesn’t matter. Any rating, any sexuality. However please don’t recommend AUs where the character is now a teacher or where the teacher’s spouse is dead, they must both be a teacher and single in the original series. 

I also prefer that they be from an anime/manga series, although you can recommend stuff from cartoons, live action, web-based etc… except Harry Potter, partially because I could just filter stuff on FanFiction.net and I’d get hundreds of stories about the one character, and partially because of the fact that I find that the majority of people who writes those fics just can’t seem to make the story not creepy and gross.

The premise was that Erik was a spy/working for the government to take down Nazis/Nazi groups and sympathizers and Charles has a connection to Shaw via Kurt Marko. Charles is not a spy, but he goes undercover because Shaw is known to be interested in men (there is period typical homophobia, but not from Erik's end)? Near the end of the fic, Shaw figures out that Charles is a spy (he noticed that Charles had swiped a key that opened a cellar that had some black powder/substance in it) and he and Emma basically start secretly poisoning Charles because their cover is blown and they'd be killed by higher up Nazis. Erik notices that Charles stops showing up to their check-up meetings and basically breaks into Shaw's home to save Charles, who is basically almost dead from being slowly poisoned. There are higher up Nazis at Shaw's house and it's implied that Shaw and Emma are killed because of everything I think? And at the end, Charles is wheelchair-bound and loses his hair and Erik leaves his job, but they're both alive and together.

Just as a quick recap, back in the episode ""Running With Scissors,"" 14-year-old Marco accepted Hekapoo's challenge to chase hundreds of her clones through various deminsions (work she herself said could take a whole lifetime) in order to blow out all their flames and earn back the deminsional scissors. He ended up taking 16 years to do all this.

I really want to write a fanfic where Marco breaks down in fear and cries for his parents during this quest. 

Nothing against Marco, I just think it would be interesting to see the weight of Hekapoo's challenge hit him. I mean, yes, he made the choice to do the challenge in the first place, but he still wouldn’t have known 100% what he was stepping into until it was too late. Let’s not forget that while Marco is tough, he's still only a 14-year-old kid and the idea of being stuck in various dimensions without a way home for 16 years just seems terrifying. I have a hard time believing he was 100% fearless and brave during *all* that time. A person can experience a lot of different emotions and act a lot of different ways in the span of 16 years and that's setting aside the fact that he was chasing Hekapoo through God-knows-where with no magic and no help from Star. 

And we don't often see child protagonists (let alone boy ones) exhibit this kind of reaction or fear (and the few times we do, it's played for laughs). Most kid characters tend to act more like adults in these types of situations, being brave and fearless and never giving up.

I've actually created two different scenarios for this premise.

- The first goes like this: 

During another sleepover, Marco starts bragging about his accomplishments in the Neverzone to impress Jackie and Janna being Janna suggests they play Truth or Punishment. Once started, she teasingly asks Marco if he ever got scared or cried for his mommy during the 16-year-quest and he laughs it off, only for the box to reveal that it's a lie. Marco reveals that one particular night during his first year or so in the Neverzone, he was at an all-time low point (he was wounded, hungry, and tired) and did actually get scared and cried for his parents. However, he realized that the only way he'd ever get to see them again would be to keep on going, so he did. To his relief, Jackie doesn't fault him for it. This, like his crossdressing, would be another example of defying manly or macho expectations (never acting weak or emotional during times of crisis).

- The second goes like this:

It takes place during Marco's quest instead of after. Here, after crying for his parents and almost dying from his injuries, he's rescued by a Toriel-like monster (from Undertale) who nurses Marco back to health, takes him under her wing, and teaches him some vital survival skills after he tells her about his quest. She offers him a home, but he turns it down, wanting to complete his quest.

In addition to the reasoning above, I also want to write this version for two reasons:

1. I don't believe Marco could have survived his first few years without any real training or survival knowledge. The guy's strong and brave and knows karate, but I never recall him knowing wildneress training. And this isn't Earth wilderness, this is some dimension where God-knows-what could be out there. The show never really highlights the dangers of traveling inbetween dimensions, let alone with magic to protect them. 

2. I like hurt/comfort stories and I like writing guardian figures. When a character is at their lowest point, I like for them to be comforted. The idea of Marco being briefly cared for by a somewhat-motherly teacher figure after going through hell just seems sweet to me.

I want to write these stories, but I'm nervous about how fans will react to it. I'm worried they will say I'm infantilizing or ruining the character of Marco. I'm not even sure if anyone would be interested in seeing this.

While I enjoy writing original fiction, I sometimes struggle with coming up with original characters so fanfiction is a total dream for me. Typically, my process has been idea first, apply characters later/find out who fits, what setting, etc. 

My most recent idea is something of a love story on the lighthearted side and slightly comedic. However, when I realized who I wanted to apply to it, two ships came to mind. Mind you, I love polyships, and I was thinking of applying it here, but I feel like it doesn't make sense for one character to agree to. But then pursuing a love triangle would probably turn my lighthearted comedy into well, a melodramatic mess. Could still be comedic, but still not part of my original intent. And I'm not opposed to writing a love triangle either. But part of resorting to that was because I couldn't pick between the two, and I don't want to have to write an ending to a love triangle. You see my predicament? lol

So, question for you all: how do you decide between two ships you love equally when writing? What if you know you love one more than the other, but the other makes more sense to the plot?

Today, we were generally conversing about aspects of our stories. I should not that the plots between both are vastly different. Though, something sparked a question in which he revealed what one of the main character’s abilities was and how it worked.

It was literally the exact same thing as mine, to the letter. It operates the exact same way as mine does. Same category of power (being an Authority) just called a different name. That’s the only difference.

I’d told him my idea previously, around a month or two (or even longer) prior to this conversation. It’s even been shown in my story already, but hasn’t been published in his just yet. Mind you, this ability is original by me and not features in canon.

I asked him if he could change anything about it. His response was, “It’s too late to change it now”, and, “Everything about it is important to the story.” Even when I offered other ways to work around it, he denied.

I honestly have no idea as to what I should do? Maybe I’m worrying over nothing, but I feel like I’m not. I told him my idea months in advance and he had plenty of time to change it, or use something else, right? What do I even do? Confront him?

w is the narrator having a phone that predicts stuff… like in Mirai Nikki for example. it doesn’t belong to the anime the author wrote about, they inserted it themselves. the phones work the exact same in my story like in the og :/ this isn’t something the author created at all but idk

- in the ff, the main character is rivals with the love interest and in mine, the main character and love interest team up right away

the plot is completely different ( high school vs college, enemies to lovers vs allies from the start, in my story they spend half the story overseas in a sort of mission ) except for two similarities — aside from the phone thing so that makes three :

- MC makes people pay in exchange for fortune telling with the help of her best friend throughout multiple chapters the og fanfiction, in mine he and his friend /used/ to do that back in high school and it stopped after something important to the plot happened. the fortune telling thing is even relevant to the story and just briefly mentioned

- the phone ultimately gets destroyed ( in the og, by the love interest himself, in mine it’s by the enemy after a kidnapping ) and after a bunch of chapters both MCs realize the fortune telling thing came from themselves not the phone as their new phone does the exact same thing

She's an incredibly popular author in all three of these fandoms, but especially the most recent past and current ones. Like, ""in the top 3 pages of all fics in the fandom sorted by kudos"" popular.

In the past few months, she's really started complaining about how annoying it is to have so many readers and comments all the time. Last week, she was nearly at 11k comments between her 3 main works. She's said several times that she thinks she should just make a new account in order to get a smaller following when she posts something new and jokingly asks me how to get a smaller reader following. I've tried being sympathetic because I'm sure it's stressful to have all that expectation from thousands of readers, and that when numbers are so high, it starts feeling more like just the notification number rather than people, but it's frustrating when she says that they don't mean anything because there are a lot.

Meanwhile, I write much more niche content about healing or character exploration that are heavily introspective and often are much slower paced. In my niche tags (one is a polyam pairing exploring how the three have a codependent friendship with the story's mc while the two others are romantically involved because they were all abused in some way growing up and how that's shaped their interactions before the climax of feelings realization and developing a healthy polyamorous relationship without that codependency) there are usually no more than 20 pages of fics and I'm rarely to page 7 or 8 out of that when sorted by kudos. I have a handful of consistent readers in each of my fics, but I don't get more than 4 or 5 comments per chapter at most. I love my commenters and it means so much when they comment, but it would be nice to have comments with speculations or specific points rather than a few ""thanks for the chapter, I really enjoyed it"". Not that I don't appreciate them, but still. I like what I post and I know that it's not going to fit everyone's interests, but it sucks to know that they're so lowly rated, let alone for someone to ask em for advice on how to make people not want to read their fic.. And I know she doesn't mean anything malicious when she asks me how to get a smaller reader pool, but it's all I can do not to snap at her that if she doesn't want people to comment on her works she should just post them anonymously, turn the comments off, or try writing something without any depth, which really isn't fair to her.

Per a recent thread, this can cause work to be lost or corrupted in the event of a connection hiccup or a website error. Editing and saving work locally is often much safer and more stable, and I have some recommendations. None of them cost money to use and (for fellow computer nerds) their source code is openly available.

- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)
  - A general office/productivity suite. The program to use here is `Writer` (a good replacement for Microsoft Word), although some of you may make use of the spreadsheet tool `Calc`(a good replacement for Microsoft Excel) in your planning.
  - The suite knows a wide variety of file formats. By default, it saves things as `Open Document` formats (`.odf`, `.ods`, etc.), but more familiar `.doc` or `.docx` are readily available if those suit your needs better. Exporting files to `.pdf` is also possible.
  - Also available is [Apache OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/download/index.html), which originates from a fork of LibreOffice.
  - Both LibreOffice and OpenOffice are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
  - This is a `plaintext` editor, as opposed to `rich text`. You can't mark for **bold** or _italic_ in this editor on its own, but if you save your files as `.html`, you can use tags to mark for `&lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;` or `&lt;i&gt;italic&lt;/i&gt;` strings of text.
  - This one is mainly for Windows users. Theoretically you could download the source code and compile on the system of your choice, but that's too much work for most people.
  - Has an option for a `portable` installation, which allows you to install the software on a flash drive or some other external media. It keeps all of the necessary operating files (for the software's internal use) in the same place, which lets you move it from computer to computer instead of having the software installed on multiple devices. It's a niche feature, but it may be useful if you switch computers a lot.
  - Most importantly, it's a hell of a lot smarter than trying to use plain old `Notepad` for authoring _anything_. And as a bonus, it has `dark mode` settings.

- [Kate] (https://kate-editor.org/get-it/)
  - Another plaintext editor. Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
  - Can be used just like Notepad++ or any other text editor, but also has an editing mode that emulates `vi`/`vim`. If you don't know what `vim` is, you don't need to worry about that feature.
  - Also has `dark mode` settings.

i write fanfic for a relatively small fandom ship, about less than 3000 fics, and lately i’ve noticed that a popular writer within that fandom has been copying and pasting paragraphs from my fics and working them into their own fics. at first, i didn’t mind much because i found it flattering but now people are complimenting and praising them for quotes i originally wrote which makes me kind of sad.

it started with them taking after my style of writing, which i noticed that it changed because they started writing in that fandom before me, but i wrote a fic that got kind of popular and then their writing style changed  to sort of emulate mine. then, after that, i noticed them starting to use lines of dialogue that are prominent in my own fics, which, okay, fine, that’s cool. but after that, they started copying and pasting literal paragraphs from my fics and putting them into their own and just rearranging the sentence structure a little or switching out a single word or two. i know it doesn’t sound like much, but i’ve memorized most of my writing so it made it super distracting. the last straw was that they copied the premise of my latest fic and even plagiarized the set up of the characters meeting, but their fic got way more hits and kudos than mine.

it’s disappointing because they’re a popular writer in the fandom and everyone loves them, but no one has noticed but me and one of my friends. i have about 11 screenshots of instances where they blatantly copied and pasted parts of my fic, and that’s only from what i’ve read so far. 

because they aren’t plagiarizing my entire fics, it’s so extremely subtle that i feel like i can’t exactly call them out on it but i can tell. would you personally confront them or just leave it alone? i might just leave it alone because they’re so popular within the fandom but i just at least wanted to vent. thank you for listening/for any advice!",True,False,False,FanFiction,t5_2r5kb,255324,public,self,a popular writer in my fandom has been plagiarizing parts of my fic,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/t2uuv5/a_popular_writer_in_my_fandom_has_been/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just as a quick recap, back in the episode ""Running With Scissors,"" 14-year-old Marco accepted Hekapoo's challenge to chase hundreds of her clones through various deminsions (work she herself said could take a whole lifetime) in order to blow out all their flames and earn back the deminsional scissors. He ended up taking 16 years to do all this.

Maybe it's because I was sheltered and wasn't very independent or brave when I was 14 or maybe I just like deconstructing child heroes, but I really want to write a fanfic where Marco breaks down in fear and cries for his parents during this quest. 

The synopsis is this: 

During another sleepover, Marco starts bragging about his accomplishments in the Neverzone to impress Jackie and Janna being Janna suggests they play Truth or Punishment. Once started, she teasingly asks Marco if he ever got scared or cried for his mommy during the 16-year-quest and he laughs it off, only for the box to reveal that it's a lie. Marco reveals that one particular night during his first year or so in the Neverzone, he was at an all-time low point (he was wounded, hungry, and tired) and did actually get scared and cried for his parents. However, he realized that the only way he'd ever get to see them again would be to keep on going, so he did. To his relief, Jackie doesn't fault him for it. This, like his crossdressing, would be another example of defying manly or macho expectations (never acting weak or emotional during times of crisis).

Nothing against Marco, I just thought it would be interesting to see the weight of Hekapoo's challenge hit him. I mean, yes, he made the choice to do the challenge in the first place, but he still wouldn’t have known 100% what he was stepping into until it was too late. Let’s not forget that while Marco is tough, he's still only a 14-year-old kid and the idea of being stuck in various dimensions without a way home for 16 years just seems terrifying. I have a hard time believing he was 100% fearless and brave during *all* that time. A person can experience a lot of different emotions and act a lot of different ways in the span of 16 years and that's setting aside the fact that he was chasing Hekapoo through God-knows-where with no magic and no help from Star. 

And this version of the character WOULD still end up being the badass dragoncycle-riding guy we saw at the end of RWS. This was just one of his really vulnerable moments.

Actually, I've also come with an alternate version to this premise.

In this other version, after crying for his parents and almost dying from his injuries, he's rescued by a Toriel-like monster (from Undertale) who nurses Marco back to health, takes him under her wing, and teaches him some vital survival skills after he tells her about his quest. She offers him a home, but he turns it down, wanting to complete his quest. 

Again, he'd still become the badass dragoncycle-riding guy, he just got a **tiny** bit of help during the early days of it. 

To be competely honest, I think a lot of why I want to write this *is* because of my childhood. In the show, the character is written in the show to be way braver and more independent than I was at his age (and even now in some areas) and I just kind of like the idea of bringing him down to my level for a moment. I guess I'm just a bit (oh my god, I can't believe I'm about to say this) jealous. Intimidated even.

I want to write these stories, but I'm scared of what all the other fans will think.

It's a lng fix regardless, the chapters rack up to 30,000 or more words sometimes or 8,000 at best so I, (and this is just me) felt lke doing what I did just made things longer, like people can pause reading and come back and I already do little (...) in between scene changes.

I am over explaining myself, but long story short: the two parters felt like a slog, made the story look longer then it should for right now and was just a phase.

I even went back and edited the other chapters to put them together as whole chapters, leaving a note that those chapters used to be split because I didn't feel like editing the notes all the way through lol.

I think what made me do that phase was... I'm gonna feel guilty for doing this, but a friend kept telling me it was too long for her and she didn't like it and two other people said that and didn't make me feel good. And I feel like they knew they were being mean because they never let up and even did weird edits shortening it when I really didn't want to and their edits removed major plot points.

I know i's long, but so what? People can skim, just read the lines, take seveeal years to read lol, not ruining my stride and shouldn't have to begin with. People already complain about the changes, lol. 

I feel good having a long fic because it makes me realize  I have it in me to write this story, is it perfect? Of course not! Is it good? Yes. And is it mine to do what I please? Hell yeah!

And I'm not saying I shouldn't take opinions or ignore people talking about the length, but if I see nothing wrong with it and enjoy it... why should I let the comments bother me? They're harmless and don't affect me thankfully.

I feel like a blabbered on and on, but I just had to get that off my chest because I finally finished my changes yesterday in my writing group and I will share my story to everyone no matter how long or short :)

My name is…I think it’s best I don’t share such intimate information considering I’m letting you all delve into a intimate experience of mine. For the few years, I have this chilly feeling that I’m going to die. Wait! Don’t jump to conclusions and think this is one of those typical stories, it isn’t…it’s something more. 

On occasion, I see this black figure - sometimes it’s still and sometimes it moves, and every time it’s in a silhouette of a person. However, one time it was a blur.

My first main encounter, well what I believe to be my first encounter was when I returned home in October 2018. I was sleeping in a room that I haven’t slept in since I was a kid and I felt the balance was off, that I wasn’t suppose to be there. Before I tell you my experience, let me set the scene. At the time, the room, I won’t say ‘my room’ because it wasn’t mine &amp; now it never will be, was facing the wardrobe. The built-in wardrobe is made up of four large mirrors that take up the 3/4 length of the room and touches the ceiling. Just to the right of the wardrobe is the door (which was closed) and to the left is the window (curtains drawn). I’m sorry I don’t know what time it was, maybe the early hours of the morning 5/6 am. I was laying in bed on my phone and I look to the far left mirror (the one near the window) and there’s this large black figure walking from one mirror to the next dragging something behind. I don’t know if it was a sack or not but it was definitely dragging something. So, it gets to the third mirror, stops and turns to look at me. No, it didn’t have eyes, well it didn’t have any features so for all I know it might have not turned to me which would make this much more disturbing. A few seconds go by when this figure and I are looking at each other and then, it pulls my legs. As cliché as it sounds, I go to scream but no sound comes out and I begin thrashing but it keeps dragging me. The weird thing is, it wasn’t dragging me anywhere but I was getting dragged and then it stopped. I was back to laying in bed as if nothing happened. Don’t think of this as a typical story written by a kid where I will say: “and suddenly I woke up and this was all a dream”. No it wasn’t a dream nor am I kid. 

Now I’m 22 and you can figure out how old I was in 2018. Every so often, no matter the environment I still see this black figure. It doesn’t drag me, but it does touch me but it mainly watches. I’m at work and it’s in the corner, I’m in my room and its right next to me. When I’m sleeping…I wake up with scratches all over my hands. Recently, I woke up with a burn mark on my left shoulder.

Funnily enough, the place I first encountered it, I never see it there. Never. I wonder what the reason is. 

The second main encounter was at university. Again, I was sleeping and suddenly I could not breathe. I woke up in a panicked state trying to catch a breath that just wasn’t in my reach. The figure was there, on my bed, looming over me. I didn’t expect it to help me, but God do something! And as I was so sure that this was it, that my end is near, alone (well not really alone if you include the figure) in my university room with nothing. It might have heard my thoughts, sympathised and went back to its own home or better yet, chosen another victim, it disappeared and finally I could breathe. Breathe. Now, I wish I didn’t take that breath and everything just came to an end there and then but here I am breathing.

Her father is a Chinese businessman based in the US and found her and brought her to America to continue her studies. Once she graduated, he gave her a job as a Vice President of a subsidiary company he owns.

Question:

1. Can her father send a petition to the government to make Anne an American citizen too if Anne's father already became an American citizen?
2. Or if it's not possible for Anne's father to change his citizenship to American but only hold a permanent residence visa instead, can Anne get a permanent residence too via her father or can she request to change her citizenship instead?

She will meet a guy and they will eventually fall in love in the future. He's American.

Question:

I saw the movie The Proposal, which is why I'm asking this. I'm also following a youtube who is from China and went to America via Fiance Visa when she married her American boyfriend.

Some people think it’s ridiculous and unnecessary that some people get so pressed about proper ship names and ship tagging. They think it’s stupid and shouldn’t matter which character is top or bottom, but the issue is bigger than it just being who is top and who is bottom! 

The issue mainly lies in characterization of the characters and the dynamics that are written for them!

Ship names are not only to show who is top or bottom, but to also show their dynamics and let the fans know about the dynamics and the characterization of the characters.

For example, character A in one of my fandoms is characterized differently in their A/B and B/A ships. 

In their A/B ship, Character A is written by fans who take on their darker sides in the canon story and develop it further. Fans of A/B like to make A meaner and darker.

For fans of B/A, they like to make A softer and focus less on his dark side. They focus on B saving A from the darkness. A, blushes more and is more like to get flustered.

However, A in the A/B fandom is more likely to be insane, not blushing and more likely to laugh maniacally. 

You see the difference?

If you’re looking to write a novel, you have your pick of  plot outlines and breakdowns to choose from, storybeat by storybeat and  scene by scene. However, there’s significantly fewer options out there  for writing shorter stories and novellas.   

One of the real beauties of fanfiction is that there is no word count  requirement. A fic can be as long or as short as the author feels it  needs to be to tell the story they’re trying to tell. This can be  freeing, but it can also be frustrating, since this kind of freeform  writing is almost impossible to find resources for. Sure, you can (and  arguably should) study novel writing and adapt the information there to  suit your needs, but it would be nice to have more advice designed by  fanfic writers for fanfic writers.  

With this goal in mind, I’ve decided to put together chapter breakdowns  of varying length, to be used by fanfic writers in structuring and  plotting their stories.  

So, like the title says, here's my ten-chapter Found Family Trope fic outline.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapter 1: Hit The Ground Running.** Drop us right into the middle of the protagonist’s conflict or struggle. Don’t waste any time with buildup -- we have limited space and since this is a fanfiction we already know these characters anyway. Give a quick rundown of the setting and powers at play, and establish the protagonist’s Goal.

**Chapter 2: Another Option.** The protagonist is offered a different way to deal with their conflict -- a way that compromises their Goal or conflicts with their Lie. The person making the offer has good intentions, but the Protagonist is set in their ways. They refuse.

**Chapter 3: Second Guessing.** Something happens that forces the protagonist to reconsider their current path. They lack something necessary to achieve their Goal, and don’t have the resources to acquire it. They reluctantly decide to set their Goal aside for now to take the other option.

**Chapter 4: Putting Down Roots.** The protagonist, in spite of themself, begins to form attachments with and a fondness for this new world and the people therein. They continue to tell themself this is only a temporary fix, and they’ll be off as soon as they’re able. 

**Chapter 5: Trouble Returns.** The more time the protagonist spends in this new world, the more they find themself reluctant to leave. They learn something important about their new world -- some threat or danger that their allies face. Their Lie is called into question and they begin to glimpse the Truth, however they remind themself they have a goal, and resolve to leave as planned. No sooner have they re-established their conviction than their past returns.

**Chapter 6: Do Or Die.** The protagonist’s New World is in danger from their own past, and they are faced with a choice -- leave the New World to continue seeking their Goal, or abandon their Goal to protect the New World. They may deliberate, but ultimately choose to stay. The way they do so is by taking on a personal mission or task that will force them to confront their Lie.

**Chapter 7: Face The Past.** The Protagonist takes off on their task, and are very nearly unable to complete it. They are assaulted with memories of the past and their own weakness, the Ghost haunts them, but the time they spent in the New World has made them stronger. They struggle but manage to endure the danger.

**Chapter 8:  False Victory.** With help from their allies, and the strength they’ve gained from the New World, the Protagonist is able to overcome the challenge they’re facing. They take a moment to breathe and celebrate -- but the second wave of danger rises on them unexpectedly, and threatens to be more dangerous than the first.

**Chapter 9: Second Coming.** The new world is not without danger -- the shadow over the protagonist’s allies has arrived, and they must all work together to see it overcome. The protagonist puts their trust in their allies, solidifying themself as a part of this new world, and together they formulate a plan to take on the threat.

**Chapter 10: Climax and Resolution.** With their teamwork and ingenuity, the protagonist and their allies are able to overcome the danger they face. They may banish the threat entirely, or merely drive it back to battle again another day. Either way, the protagonist is rewarded for their courage and loyalty. They may be given a way to achieve their initial goal without losing their new Tribe, or they may move on from the goal entirely in pursuit of better things.",True,False,False,FanFiction,t5_2r5kb,255016,public,self,Ten Chapter Found Family Trope Fanfic Outline,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/t2ivcx/ten_chapter_found_family_trope_fanfic_outline/,all_ads,6,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just as a quick recap, back in the episode ""Running With Scissors,"" 14-year-old Marco accepted Hekapoo's challenge to chase hundreds of her clones through various deminsions (work she herself said could take a whole lifetime) in order to blow out all their flames and earn back the deminsional scissors. He ended up taking 16 years to do all this.

Maybe it's because I was sheltered and wasn't very independent or brave when I was 14 or maybe I just like deconstructing child heroes, but I really want to write a fanfic where Marco breaks down in fear and cries for his parents during this quest. 

The synopsis is this: 

During another sleepover, Marco starts bragging about his accomplishments in the Neverzone to impress Jackie and Janna being Janna suggests they play Truth or Punishment. Once started, she teasingly asks Marco if he ever got scared or cried for his mommy during the 16-year-quest and he laughs it off, only for the box to reveal that it's a lie. Marco reveals that one particular night during his first year or so in the Neverzone, he was at an all-time low point (he was wounded, hungry, and tired) and did actually get scared and cried for his parents. However, he realized that the only way he'd ever get to see them again would be to keep on going, so he did. To his relief, Jackie doesn't fault him for it. This, like his crossdressing, would be another example of defying manly or macho expectations (never acting weak or emotional during times of crisis).

Nothing against Marco, I just thought it would be interesting to see the weight of Hekapoo's challenge hit him. I mean, yes, he made the choice to do the challenge in the first place, but he still wouldn’t have known 100% what he was stepping into until it was too late. Let’s not forget that while Marco is tough, he's still only a 14-year-old kid and the idea of being stuck in various dimensions without a way home for 16 years just seems terrifying. I have a hard time believing he was 100% fearless and brave during *all* that time. A person can experience a lot of different emotions and act a lot of different ways in the span of 16 years and that's setting aside the fact that he was chasing Hekapoo through God-knows-where with no magic and no help from Star. 

And this version of the character WOULD still end up being the badass dragoncycle-riding guy we saw at the end of RWS. This was just one of his really vulnerable moments.

For comparison, watch the Steven Universe episode ""Adventures in Light Distortion."" There's a great moment towards the end where &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;!their spaceship is about to explode while traveling at hypespeed, the Crystal Gems are poofed, and Steven, typically the fun-loving ball of determination, gets scared, starts crying, and says he wants his dad.!&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; It's a rare scene of emotional vulnerability that you don't see in a lot of cartoons (at least played 100% seriously and not for laughs).

Actually, I've also come with an alternate version to this premise.

In this version, after crying for his parents and almost dying from his injuries, he's rescued by a Toriel-like monster (from Undertale) who nurses Marco back to health, takes him under her wing, and teaches him some vital survival skills after he tells her about his quest. She offers him a home, but he turns it down, wanting to complete his quest.

Yeah, this is again me not accepting that he was able to survive 16 years on his own with no guardian or mentor figure (as brief as they were). The character is written in the show to be braver and more independent than I was at his age and I just kind of like the idea of bringing him down to my level for a moment. I also like writing these types of parent-like characters and relationships (mainly because I myself am very close to my parents).

Because the show never showed it, I’m planning on writing a fic where the CGs apologize for keeping Lapis in the mirror, she makes peace with them, and decides to become a Crystal Gem.

However, I have two big problems.

- The first problem is that I don’t really understand what Lapis truly wants.

Does she want help in recovering from her mirror trauma? Her statement about the Gems being selfish in “Ocean Gem” said to me that she wants (or wanted) support or somebody to care about her.

Does she want to be help accountable and suffer consequences for her harmful actions? “Alone at Sea” said to me that she wants to be punished or seen as a bad Gem for her crimes instead of being excused for them.

What does she want from the CGs? Is she afraid of what they think of her? Does she feel the need to apologize to the Gems or is she waiting for them to apologize?

- The other problem is that I don’t know how much blame should be directly placed on Lapis (and I'm not sure if I can really blame her).

You see, I do see some truth in Lapis’ statement about the Gems only caring for the Earth and not other Gems from “Ocean Gem.” When Steven told them she was talking to him in “Mirror Gem,” they were just going to bubble her instead of figuring out what she was. They aren’t as compassionate or open-minded as Steven. If the Gems want Lapis to trust them, they need to show her that they care about her.

I also think her actual mirror trauma got swept under the rug and wasn’t explored as the reason for her bad actions. She stole the ocean because she wanted to be free of Earth and had no connection to the planet like Steven and the CGs. Her being captured by Jasper and Peridot and brought back to Earth was forcing her to relive the trauma she suffered in the mirror. IMO, Jasper grabbing her at the end of “Jailbreak” and trying to get her to fuse with her was akin to a sexual abuse victim getting groped. It caused her to snap and finally decide “*f@ck it, if I’m stuck in this hell, I’ll take Jasper down with me*.”

These are the reasons I don’t hate Lapis for what she’s done. When someone brings up her torture of Jasper or her being mean to Peridot or her stealing the ocean, I can’t help, but reflect to the above reasons.
 
However, I was recently watching the Breaking Bad episode “Problem Dog” and got to the scene where Jesse blows up at the Narcotics Anonymous leader for suggesting that he stop beating himself up and stop judging himself. Jesse argues that he shouldn’t just excuse the bad things he’s done or will do, that you can’t simply accept the stuff you’ve done when you aren’t punished for it. This made me wonder if I should view Lapis in a different light.

A **big** part of me still wants for the Gems to apologize to Lapis and acknowledge their selfishness in my fic, but I’m conflicted on whether I’m simply trying to excuse her bad actions. That I’m victimizing her too much.

I still believe that Lapis committed her atrocities because she was never given help and had trust issues. I still want the Gems to acknowledge that she needed help and didn't get it. That they promise to start caring for other Gems (as well as her).

But I'm scared that I'm defending an abuser.

The current project I'm working on is a big ol' crossover, think Super Robot Wars, more than 10 different canon series coming together for crossover plots and a big Crisis Crossover style main threat they have to deal with. Long, long fic, all things said and done. Completely putting aside that most people would advise me not to write that kind of thing,   


I wanted to give readers who do want to get into it without necessarily knowing every series involved some resource to get up to snuff. I wanted to write character profiles! Character's name, age, appearance (if they are a non-canon character, or their sense of style has changed meaningfully since the time of their home series), history, and their 'kit', you know, what they can *do.* Which leads me to my problem:  


I can't really just put the profiles at the start or end of each chapter they appear in, huh? I value surprise value a little too much, so I would definitely not do them at the start and say outright which characters debut in a given chapter. I don't want to put them at the end, either; that isn't very helpful in the chapter itself. Optimally, it'd be best to be able to hotlink the first appearance of a character's name to these little profiles, so people who have no idea who this person is can give it a look if they so desire, and it's completely unobtrusive to the people who do know that series, right?

but the night before yesterday, i was in the bathroom when i was inspired with a plot. i quickly recorded it in the voice memo app and went to sleep, a tiny hope lit within me that i might write it and not abandon it like my other fics but i didn’t believe too strongly in it.

But then come yesterday, i was feeling a bit depressed and my brain was telling me to write, write, write. the only fic that i wanted to write was that one. so i kept daydreaming about it as i went on with my morning. and then i had this idea that “if i wanted to write this one shot, then it’s going to be in first person point of view.”

i was honestly confused at first because i don’t like reading in 1st pov. i couldn’t connect to the characters much so how could i write in that pov? none the less, i got my coffee, a kit kat and opened my laptop with a piano piece playing on repeat.

to be honest, i didn’t think that i would write anything. except for maybe two hundred words if i was lucky. but i somehow zoned out and when i came to, i’ve already written almost 400 words. i was honestly surprised.

encouraged by this, i continued to write, write, write.

i did some research for the one shot, tried implementing the show don’t tell method into my writing and even used a dictionary to improve my vocabulary bank.

almost nine and a half hours later, after 8520 words, amazing encouragement from friends and a bowl of ramen later, my one shot was compete.

i posted it last night and it’s still to early to determine if it flopped or not but even if it did, i’m proud of myself.

But, as someone with extremely low self esteem, internet strangers' validation actually matters to me, so just let me vent.

I've been thinking about this idea for a long time. I've written a really long outline, perfectly planning out every plot point and every scene. I made character sheets for my whole cast. Since it's an AU (and my ship *loves* AUs) that's set in my own made up town, I even took the time to do a bunch of research on how towns are built and carefully plan out where everything is. And I even drew a map! I even drew all the outfits my characters would be wearing most often! I spent so much time carefully thinking everything over. I even sacraficed some of my grades to work on this!

I was *so* excited about it! I bothered all my friends with endless rants about the story at ungodly hours of the night, I'm pretty sure they're all sick of me by now. I loved the concept and I loved the plot and everything about it. This is the fastest I've ever finished writing something because I was so damn excited to work on it!

I finally posted the first chapter yesterday and... it *completely* flopped. Compared to all my other fics, this one is doing absolutely *awful*. I even had multiple people unsubscribe from me right after I posted it. I know that this doesn't mean my writing is bad or anything, but it's seriously discouraging as fuck.

I mean, my ship *has* been slowly dying each day. Rarely any fics get as many kudos or hits as they used to (save for the most popular writer for the ship with a large following). I'm no exception. I know that. But it doesn't mean that I can't be disappointed.

When I fist checked my stats after posting, they were *depressing*. I was very, very close to deleting it impulsively. I didn't do it, but I'm honestly thinking about discontinuing it already. I lost any and all interest I had in the story. Whenever I think about it now, I get reminded of how badly it flopped and how stupid I was to think that it wouldn't. I no longer have any will to continue writing it, even though I used to be *so* fucking excited about it. It was the only thing I was able to think about for so long, and now I just want it to be gone.

I know how I sound, trust me I do. But I can't help it.

Basically in the beginning the character believes in something that is false, Ex) I am worthless. By the end of the story they should know the truth, Ex) I am valuable. The origin of misbelief is figuring out where the lie came from, Ex) Toxic home environment. 

This has really helped me understand my characters more and have a better idea as to where I’m going with the story! I totally recommend :)
