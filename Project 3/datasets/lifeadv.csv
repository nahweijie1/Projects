My sister moved away three years ago to another continent. My aunt, uncle and cousins moved to another continent too, about a year ago. My boyfriend left for 6 months for an exchange to another continent too. And he told me a couple days ago that he wants to take a break from the relationship. That he doesn’t wanna break up, but he wants to take a break because of the distance, and he’s “busy” all the time. My grandfather died barely a month ago from cancer suddenly. 

Before my boyfriend left, we had an argument. My parents grounded me because I drank alcohol (I’m 23 years old, I know I shouldn’t be grounded). So when they grounded me, they wouldn’t let me go to have dinner to my boyfriends house, days before he left for the exchange. It was extremely difficult for me and I’m still angry. My boyfriend couldn’t believe why I couldn’t just “escape” my house to see him, but he doesn’t understand how my family dynamics work.

My mother is abusive and gets away with mistreating me whenever she wants. If she gets upset she yells at me and tells me horrible things. 

Now my sister came to visit with her boyfriend from another country, and I can’t help but think of the day they leave, and I’m alone again. And also, my boyfriend that took a break from the relationship barely replies to my texts and if he does, he takes a lot of hours to do so. I’m afraid he met someone else and I feel horrible. 

I feel like I am not enough or that I don’t have value because of how disposable I feel I am. I feel like I’m completely alone. I don’t have another brother or sister and I feel completely alone and I wanna end it. 

This is really hard. Please help me. I hate it when my boyfriend just ignores me, I don’t deserve this. And I miss everyone. Help me :(

At home, I have my son (16).

Outside of the house, I have my niece (12) who lives 30 minutes away.

I work 40+ hrs a week. Physically demanding, between 8-12 hr days. Mainly monday through Friday, sometimes Saturday. My hours vary between 10am to 2am (normally 10am-10pm). 

Once the weekend hits, I'm exhausted but I still have my own household to handle (my laundry, dinner plans, cleaning up, etc). I'm also the one who drives my sons grandma around on Saturday. Sometimes, it's to the tobacco store and she'll grab herself a lunch. Other times, it'll be a 5 hr grocery trip. This Saturday, she has an appt at the hospital that I'm taking her to, and I gotta stay there. 

My niece has been through hell and she struggles with depression, suicidal tendencies, etc... so I try to make time for her... but her guardian also has her enrolled in other things that take up her weekends (which is amazing, I love it and fully support it 100%). This past weekend, my niece was being rude and I finally ""snapped"". Shes been rude towards me everytime I've seen her (try to make it every weekend)... and honestly, I question why I should have to deal with the disrespect when I can organize and clean my house that I've been neglecting, ya know.. spend time with my own child. She said I haven't been there for her lately ""with everything going on"" (again been through hell in her past, bullies at school currently, things like that). 

So how am I supposed to divide my time? Last Saturday morning, I went through my patio and the storage section of the apartment, then skipped my time with my son to go hang out with my niece at her house. Sunday, she was busy with her stuff but I had to take care of grandma and my brother had a mental health crisis (that really lasted from Saturday night until sunday late evening). My son worked all sunday so I only seen him that night. I also do most of my dog training during the weekend.

I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders... and I can't neglect anyone bc how dare I do that?... but sometimes, I feel like I'm pouring from an empty bucket. I have nothing left to give!... but again, I feel like their needs are their needs and I have to attend to them. My wants of whatever doesnt matter bc honestly, idk what I even want.

I can clearly remember having these feelings as far back as 6 or 7 years old.

My problem is, I'm a mess and I don't know what to do about it.

I am the type of person that gets good at things rather quickly. I'm by no means becoming 'excellent' or achieving an expert level at everything I do. I would describe it more like ""somehow I avoid most of the hurdles that people typically face when beginning things. I reach a higher intermediate level rather quickly"".

It is difficult to describe but a few examples could be:

- Being able to play complicated bar chords and technically difficult music, cleanly, after around one and a half weeks after beginning to play guitar.

- Having most of my kickboxing class believe I was lying about never having done the sport before because of the ""high level of technique I had"" after 2-3 lessons.

- It was assumed that I cheated in my high school science SAT test (I was 13-14) because I received the second highest score in the region. I was a problem child, to be blunt about it and I didn't pay much attention, messed around, got suspended from school regularly or/and had fights in the classroom. So although I received an award in the year assembly I was still placed in the lowest science class; a science tutor (not employed by my school) came and spoke to my science teacher and offered to give me extra time and was turned away and told that it was a fluke/I cheated.

I feel like it's a valid question, so I'll answer it directly. No, I didn't cheat. I just found that the curriculum made sense to me and it seemed very easy. To clarify a little more, I don't believe this makes me a genius or anything of the sort. I also hope to not come across as braggadocious. I'm an objective person, and understand it is relatively simple science compared to college or university level study. It's only meant to serve as an example. 

Back to the problem, I have no lust for anything. I can still feel happiness and excitement, but they are so scarce; and often fleeting. I can't escape this idea that everything is just so pointless. 

I become good at something, then become almost ""fatigued"" by the success I'm having at it. 

I recently (relatively, August 2021) started coding. I finished a JavaScript course then started a Front End Engineer course and joined a group on Discord to see if the community aspect would help at all. It didn't, unfortunately. I learned for 4 hours a day, 5 days a week for 3.5 months. Come the end of December, and up to the point of posting, I have zero lust whatsoever to even look at the code.

I made some cool things, responsive designs, a few company websites, some cool  dynamic JS and CSS interactions. Everyone in my group was impressed, asked questions about how I did certain aspects and generally said it was great work. But again the question arose in my head. ""What's the point?"". 

I even tried trading and made super outsized returns. I'm by no means set for life, but I made more than I would have made in 7-8 years working in a 2 year period. I could have kept going, the 'incentive' was there but I just don't see the point. 

Even if I made a million tomorrow, this feeling would still be here with me. I can't drown it (I tried, with alcohol for months; I no longer touch alcohol) I can't run away from it (I also tried that, travelling for 3 years) and I can't remember what it was like to not feel this way, anymore. 

I don't even know if this is a question. I just know that despite having numerous, what many people would call, 'god-given-talents', I am just so lacking in desire, motivation and energy for everything. 

I'm 32 years old, I work a shitty job, and have almost nothing in the way of achievement to show for my time here on earth. 

I feel like I don't know how to aim myself towards fulfilling this life long feeling and I'm running out of hope. I've began contemplating death as an option.

Who I am; I'm a 18yr old high school student living with my parents (uncle and dad, mom isn't family to me) and a younger sibling in rural America. I think alot of these problems are my fault and it's wrecking me 


Current stuff for me:
I feel my life is going to shit and it's largely my fault. I'm of course 18 years old now and in the last year of high school in America. I am as of now home sick and dreading talking to my dad about it; the context is I've hated school since middle school due to utter shit school and imo the start of an electronics addiction, I've since gotten better at, and thus I tried to stay home alot calling sick, or getting picked up. This didn't get better during highschool and in the end this year I missed a bit again, not as big chunks any more but still. A couple of times when I faked being sick my dad yelled at me to basically suck it up, he works all night to support the family while I am here doing jack shit (not his words but his meaning, and I can do my classes online anyways). Now I'm here actually sick and was dreading going to school cause 1 asshole us gov teacher but fine rest of day. I told my uncle when he came to check on me in the morning I needed to get Ibprophen as my headache was back and he sighed telling me to stay in bed. So I lay in bed struggling to sleep as my little brother gets ready to go to school and I hear my uncle talking about how I am basically pathetic and he doesn't wanna tell me that but he can't hold back. Now I wait till dad wakes up and have him probably scream at me again cause I didn't go to school while sick, then he's going to point out what he does for us and that my brother is so much better, and then going to talk about how I can't do anything; it happens every time in different orders.


How it all came to this:

When I was around 14 my mother and father divorced and I had to deal with the fallout after my mother basically abandoned us, going on about how she wanted to do so many things and had to take time to be young (she's late 40s early 50s now) I had so much stress to deal with added on to moving from a family house to a barely 1 person ""house."" I started to shut down, and my parents really started focusing on keeping me and my brother afloat but because of that and a whole ""thank you but the best thing is to stay out of the way"" mentality I wasn't able to learn what I needed to do, how to do it, hell I ended up regressing cause of this and am to this day feeling the fallout of that. Now that I'm becoming an adult and just coasting by I don't know how to cook, clean, drive, focus too much in things, put effort, or connect with people and in all honesty I've neglected personal cleanliness. I'm short and I'm lonely so when I was way back when I made an online persona of a tall hot muscular woman just so I could feel I was looked up to by people and I wanted to go trans, but now I'm a little more sure I'm a male who's straight and cis gender. The problem comes with all of my friends and communities I'm in being linked to that persona even an online relationship with a woman i love and a guy I like as a close friend. I want to move on but it's sunk cost, I'm weak and I can't bring myself to come out and ruin everything I worked for because when it started I was a manipulative pos

What I want:
I want to find a way to move on, I want to physically work on myself, become a better person, pursue a career I have a real chance in, and actually get in a dedicated relationship with someone that if we weren't dating could still be friends and of course 2 way respect of each other.

I want my parents to stop calling me useless to my face or behind my back then scold me for shutting down cause I'm basically underdeveloped mentally and can barely find the motivation to get up in the morning... 

I don't know what I even need to do anymore, irl help isn't an option cause no money and my parents don't believe in mental health and would only point out I've made my own bed and have to lay in it now...

Last winter I started taking an acting class (I’ve always wanted to try - I’ve always loved movies). The first set of classes were great: I learned how hard it was to act, many different techniques, valuable information for headshots and auditions etc.

The second set of classes have started and they are pay as you go, not one lump sum like the first set, and honestly I don’t know if I want to do it anymore.

I’m not sure if I wanted to try and it see and then move on - I never had any intention of trying to be an actor, more so I wanted to try something I’ve always been interested in.

Stupid question, but, should I feel guilty for not pursuing? Or is it just anxiety of a heightened level of learning that is giving me pause?

So I've been in a relationship with the most amazing person for over a year now and I love her to bits and would do pretty much anything for her.
She struggles with pretty severe anxiety/depressive phases as well as having no plans whatsoever for her future. She hates her course but cannot monetarily afford to change it and therapy/councelling are very slow to get as she cannot afford a private therapist.
Whenever she talks to me about these problems I feel incredibly helpless, I've tried everything in my power to help amd it has had minor successes but she still struggles a lot every day.
I am by no means perfect, and I have been working on my flaws (especially my forgetfulness) but I just don't know how to further help her, but it is all I want.
I have a very specific view of life and how I'd like to live it but I am very aware that that does not apply to everyone, and many times when I try to show her how I cope with things she just doesn't understand.
I also don't want to risk making anything worse which is why I try not to advise her to make big changes in life, because I don't know how it will affect her as it might make the whole situation worse.

This feels weird, I never posted something like this in the internet, but the nature of my problem prevents me from asking people irl for help.

I don't know when or why this started, but I remember one day that I didn't pick up the phone in the whole day, and then the next one, and I ended up spending the whole Christmas holiday without talking to any of my friends or anyone, but my family (that I live with). When I ended my self-imposed isolation, it wasn't the same and hasn't been the same since then.

I feel repulsion everytime I think of talking to anyone. I'm not shy at all, it's not hard for me to talk to people, I just don't feel like doing so. I've always been introverted (in the sense that I prefer to stay alone) but never like this.

I don't wanna talk to literally anyone, I need help with college but asking my classmates for help seems like a horrible task. The new Batman movie came out and I will probably go alone to the movies since I don't wanna talk to anyone. My phone broke and I purposely kneecapped everyone that tried to help me in order to delay my reconnection to the world (referring to social media).

This is a problem because I need people in my life in order to be happy (as any other human being). This isolation is causing me other problems.

Thinking about the possible causes of my issue, COVID isolated me from the world ( firstly quarantine and then virtual college), and when I started in-person college, my social battery with fully recharged, so I didn't have any problem talking to anyone, and then maybe I overstepped my introversion so I don't have any energy to talk to anyone. However, I started in-person college on September, and it's been 7 months.

Other reason might be another problems that may affect my mental health. Maybe I'm not good for other reasons and my brain just blocks any activity that might be tiring (like talking to people) to prevent more issues. Is that a thing? Idk.

I've managed to wrack up a credit card debt of about £2000 from not having a job during last lockdown and needing to pay rent/living costs. I'm stable now with a job in a bar which pays my rent and living costs and I'm starting to eat at the credit card debt. 

During my time in my degree I have found it a struggle. I came from a film BA and so have experience in film production and research but have really lost my passion for it recently. Most of the people on the course haven't done anything film related so in the production modules it feels like I'm back in first year and trying to guide them without sounding patronising is backfiring resulting in me not being listened too at all. So socially I feel outcast and the production modules aren't as fun as they were in undergrad. 

The research modules are much more arduous than the undergrad but were managable until this term. All the classes got switched to mornings, I work in a bar which means I don't get home til 4am most nights and can't go, and havent been to most of the classes this term. The teachers breathe down my neck rather than offer support or alternatives.

I just wonder if its worth finishing or going full time at my job to clear my debt, become financially independent and move back home to find a career in the film industry.

So right now, I'm 21, living in a stable family, and am currently on track to get a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.

I find the subject very interesting and it was all thanks to how my highschool calculus teacher made things fun for me. It's my last semester, I am on track to graduate in 2-3 months. I have a GPA of 3.85 out of 4.0, (mostly A or A- student), so safe to say I have really been working hard on my own despite the professors not teaching me anything. Yet despite all of this, it feels like I've learned from my education absolutely nothing useful, as all the stuff they asked me to cram into my head, though very interesting, has been forgotten in favor of cramming new info into my head. Adding pressure to this is how everyone around me is either continuing with grad school or getting jobs, and saying that I should be looking for one soon, despite not feeling ready for that at all. 

Throughout my education, my friends in my major and I have come across some very difficult classes, and for the past three/four years, I've not only extensively researched the necessary topics to prepare for exams, but I also found teaching the topics of study to my friends to be a very useful method of exam prep. This and the fact that I tutor a younger sister in all fields of highschool math as well as friends in calculus and physics made me also realize that I enjoy the process of teaching and tutoring rather than the subjects themselves, despite my lack of experience with them.

Also enter my passion project and hobby: Lego. For more context in this area, I am a Instagram content creator who specializes in building Tanks from WW2 with Lego bricks in Minifigure scale (non political but historically motivated I guess). I've been into Lego for my whole life but have started my page in 2016, and have improved since then by a lot! All the models I build come from my own creativity and hours of work. I was asked if I wanted to be part of a third party, non Lego affiliated team where I would make model kits for them. I know for sure that there is a market for this and that my existing fans would love for me to take this more seriously to create more vehicles and stuff they can build and use in their Lego dioramas. If you want a better idea of some of the stuff I do, my Instagram is @panzer.bricklabs_1944 (not trying to shamelessly insert myself). 

Which leads to the question...
I'm overwhelmed with these options. Where do I go? I feel like being part of a company as a kit freelance designer and content creator would be a once in a lifetime opportunity that I wouldn't want to pass up. Building and designing with lego is such a passion of mine that I wouldn't want to ever give it up. At the same time it's such a risk financially as I'd like to start supporting my mom and dad who have been working for my sake. Teaching is another passion of mine and right now I plan to enroll to be a tutor or something just for some income but I'm not sure if I want to pursue this path as my career. And for some reason it took until my graduation to start doubting if engineering really is my thing despite my interest in mathematics and physics. Not going into an engineering job despite spending 8k annually for college seems like a huge waste of potential and I'd feel like an ungrateful child to have squandered this opportunity due to my lack of confidence and uncertainty about going into the field. There's a lot more complex feelings I have but for now I think that's all there is to say; I'm just lost :/",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,29130,public,self,A three forked road.

Since high school I’ve tried college 3 times but dropped out due to mental health and personal problems. I’ve worked as a server, bar-back, bouncer, stocker, cashier, done flooring, cleaned up pools and yards, and other random jobs around town for money. I’m currently working as a server again and it’s okay, but I want to do MORE and know I’m capable of it if I can sort out what it is I want to do. I’m tired of not living up to my potential I suppose.

Anyways, I had to move back in with family recently because I can’t afford my own apartment around here. I’m fortunate to have this but also am itching for my own place (I’ve always had roommates and siblings to share with). I’m thinking of moving to a different city that’s cheaper, has more people my age, and more opportunities for whatever I decide to do. But I don’t know for sure. I don’t have confidence in myself and I’ve heard advice of all sorts regarding moving or not.

I could also stay with family and finish up my degree, but that would take 2 years and I don’t know if I can handle living with them in this old, boring town for that long. I could stay and work a different job and try to work my way up I guess but that doesn’t sound all that good. There’s any number of things I could do really…

But I feel like I want to move. Even if I’m a server (and hopefully work up to bartender) and make okay money, I could afford my own place and everything. I’d have to budget but it could be good for me. I don’t know. It’s tough for me to make a decision because I’m afraid of making the wrong one.

I have $7,000 saved up at the moment and only a little student loans to pay off. My car is paid off though and insurance is cheap. I pay all my bills by myself now anyways and have before when I lived with roommates. I just feel like having my own apartment and being able to be around more people my age and the city life with a few friends I already know would be a good start to figuring out what I want. It’d be a way to get off the stump and try out on my own again.

I guess I sort of know what I want but the advice I get from family and others I’ve asked has been all over the place. Some want me to move to a city closer by, others suggested I get a better job here first and save up more money and build my resume, some think me moving out on my own is asking for trouble and that I can’t really afford it. And then my own doubts and concerns get in the way…

Like, is it actually the right call? Is working as a server/bartender and hardly being able to save much money worth it? Will I actually meet more people and have more opportunities? Am I just thinking the grass is greener?

There’s positives and negatives to any decision I’d make. Staying with family gives me a chance to save more money and maybe go back to school without having to take a full-time job. I’d spend more time with them and see more of my younger siblings who are still growing up. But then I’ve heard moving out and gaining independence can be great for you, the challenges and problems that up come can help you grow. Either way, there’s good or bad possibilities.

I don’t know… but I do know that making no choice is a choice, that the worst decision is no decision… so I have to choose.

The tl;dr is the title, but this is a long ass story to be able to explain why I want to do this bc im aware the title just makes me sound like a complete asshole.

(Yes the following is all relevant to the question, its much needed backstory for this post.)

So I'm 19, and I normally live with my mum. I had my entire teenage years up until this year stolen away from me, first by severe and crippling mental illness, then by severe physical illness that stopped me from being able to go to school or any other education. 

At 18 I decided to try going to college, but that was when the pandemic was happening, and I had no idea how COVID would effect me with my illness and none of my classmates or teachers gave a shit about COVID rules which made me feel incredibly unsafe, so I quit. When I told my dad and stepmum I quit college, they offered to let me work at the place my stepmum works at for a 3 month training period, but I would have to live with them for that time, and I agreed to it, fully expecting it to only be 3 months of living with them, and then I'd be able to work from my mums remotely.

That did NOT happen. It turned out that going into the office once a week was not something that was just required for training, and was in fact just part of the job. Basically meaning in order to keep the job, I had to move in with them permanently. This was NOT something I wanted to do at all. I love living with them, but I also love living with my mum more as she lives closer to the rest of my family, and I absolutely hate being away from my family.

I've been here almost a year now, and I really just don't want to waste my official last teenage year living in a place where I don't want to live, away from most of my family, away from my pets, and away from my only friend.

But someone else at work quit, and whats even worse is my dad's close friend died, and I feel like I'd be a horrible person to leave now. But at the same time, the clock is ticking. It's March already, I started working for this company last April so I planned to quit and go home this April, which is literally next month.

I haven't felt so fucking depressed in ages, I've been here way too long and everyone's started to think I want to permanently live here. But I really don't. I think I left it way too late.

Should I be a selfish asshole and quit and go home next month, or do I stay for longer even though I feel like absolute shit, incredibly depressed and am constantly fighting the urge to relapse on self harming?

Recently I've been struggling with planning for my future and feel like I've dug myself into a pit.

As graduation inches closer, I've realized that I don't actually want a job with my chosen major. 

I've expressed this to friends and family and so far everyone has given me the same advice: finish the degree and get a job do you can have a house and a family one day.

Although this is my junior year, I still have around 3 years to finish my bachelor's degree because I've been taking less classes and paying my way through via a part time retail job.

Thus far I've been able to avoid student loans entirely. However, as I've slowly been taking less classes every semester I've realized that what I'm doing is really a stalling tactic because graduating means getting a real job.

I chose Computer Science because the minimal programming I had done before college was fun and everything I've learned so far I've enjoyed but I simply cannot imagine myself working a 9-5 from home or an office, as a part of someone else's business selling a product, maintaining a website/service, etc...

In addition, every two weeks for the past two years whenever I've had a homework project for computer science I've consistently spent an entire day on my bed in tears in the fetal position, racked with a mixture of anxiety and depression. 

Only work for my computer science classes triggers this. It's gotten to the point where I have to plan ahead on having a ""freak out day"" before I actually want to get started on programming. I fear that nothing would change if I got a job with my degree because then my livelyhood is at stake and not just a letter grade.

I've let others know about this, and they recommend that I sign up for the campus therapy for students. I agree, but the instant I get the project done and turned in therapy makes as much sense as filling a bath with cheese wiz and jumping in.

I feel absolutely fine otherwise, my anxiety episodes are only triggered by performing anything programming-related.

Even though I'm done with GE's as of this semester, I'm not even in the ""professional"" program yet. Some I've talked to, including my parents, reccomend quitting my job and taking out loans to finish school as fast as possible so I can start making an ""adult"" salary.

They are insistent about this no matter how many times I explain thinking about having a programming job makes me sick to my stomach.

I feel like I have no choice but to keep going. It's the smart thing to do.

My heart however, tells me to follow what I want to do regardless of money.

If it were completely up to me, I would like to try being a vtuber and streaming. I know it's a pipe dream and many people try but select few succeed but I don't want to give up on a dream I haven't tried. I'm not in it for fame or fortune either, I genuinely enjoy making other people happy and producing online content is probably the easiest method to do so.

There's also the joke of becoming a furry artist, except for me it's a possible reality.

I've been running a NSFW Deviantart page off and on since last summer and have over 1000 watchers, I could definitely start making money off it If I wanted to. Not exactly rent money, but income nonetheless.

Should I do the smart thing or follow my dreams?

She didn’t. She said she wasn’t looking for romance, and really that she wasn’t the romance type at all. I totally understand that, and I still look forward to us being great friends in the future. But these last few days I haven’t been able to defeat the return of my depression. You see, she came into my life when I was struggling with addiction, and just the thought of a future with her was enough for me to curb that addiction. Even now in my depression, I haven’t regressed into it, and I don’t think I ever will. She was like a light in the darkness, and even as a friend, she can still be that light. But at the same time there is a feeling in the pit of my stomach that I haven’t been able to free myself from for the last few days, and I really just don’t know what to do. I’m sleeping through most of the day trying to escape a life I don’t want, into dreams where I can at-least pretend I don’t still have feelings for someone who won’t ever return them. I genuinely feel lost. Has anyone on here ever been through something like this? 

I’ve been turned down several times before but it’s never hit me this hard.

Hi. I (22,F) want to break up with my boyfriend (23M), but am worried it is going to negatively affect his mental health.

Context:

We were friends for years before we started dating and I really do love him. We have also hooked up a couple of times before we started dating so this was kinda an on and off thing and then we eventually said we'd give it a go. 

While I think the relationship is going well for them I'm not feeling the romantic connection I thought I would. 

There are a couple of reasons for this. We go to different universities in separate cities and he lives in our home town. I'm not really a big texter and prefer to spend time in person which isn't really possible apart from visits. 

I'm also kinda scared of wasting the best years of my life being in a relationship I'm not really committed to where I'm not able to even interact with him.

I was really big into him when we were younger and now we've grown up I don't feel that attracted to him anymore. Despite this, we have kinda similar personalities and get on really well which is why I was willing to give the relationship a go.

Which I think is a valid enough reason for breaking up. We tried it and it didn't work.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the issue. 

Due to anxiety, he failed his last year in university so he's taking a year out while he retakes a few select classes, which I'm aware has led to him feeling a bit isolated and has put a further strain on his mental health. 

He's also struggled with eating disorders (ED) in the past and in the last few years has gained some weight, leading him to now be quite insecure and in the past week, he's mentioned that he had a mini-relapse which he has now said he has gotten under control. 

I'm now in a position where I feel like I want to break up, but I also care a lot for him and don't want to fuck up his mental health any more than it already is. 

He's coming down to visit next weekend and I was thinking of breaking up then. But I'm worried that even if I shift away from the focus of loss of physical attraction, he'd still jump to the conclusion that it's all because of his weight - potentially spiralling him into an ED episode. 

I'm not sure whether I should wait longer or what. I don't feel trapped like they're not hanging the threat of an ED over my head, but I am acutely aware that it is an issue. 

I also want to continue being friends after it is over as that's what we were originally but I'm not sure if this is possible. I feel like if I delay breaking up and then admit I've wanted to for a while eventually when we break up, it'd hurt them more than if I did it now.

I'm 20 years old. I got my first job at amazon at 18 where I would only work 10 hours on each Saturday and Sunday. I hated this job for many reasons including doing the same thing for 9.5 hours, loud noises which gave me headaches even with ear plugs, my body feeling destroyed after work, my managers would only talk to me when I did something wrong, and the expectation for you to pick an item every 7 seconds. I normally was very on track, but they would start saying I made errors on days that I never even worked and became rude. After a year of that, I quit and attempted to do DoorDash for a bit, but with all the money I needed for gas and needing to take out taxes, it didn't seem very worth it for me. I tried to work at Walmart. This job wasn't horrible. I had to talk to customers at time which I didn't enjoy because I'm pretty awkward, and the managers were pretty rude but I didn't mind that as much. I aimed to only work 20 hours a week because I was signed up for a one month introductory computer science bootcamp course, but Walmart ended up scheduling me 32-40 hours and on days I told them I couldn't because of the course. I had already paid the money for the bootcamp, so I left Walmart after none of the managers were able to help me (I talked to both of my team leads which both said would reach back to me and never did and the people's lead who only changed my schedule for one week). 

&amp;#x200B;

I now work at amazon again (I applied to many jobs closer to me but none of them wanted to hire me, I'm not sure what I was doing wrong), but in a different building doing different stuff. This is the best job I've had and I've been there for about 3 months. I tend to do different things, everyone is really kind so far, and I have a flexible schedule. The problem is that I hate even the idea of going to work. I thought I would be happier with easier, different work and a flexible schedule, but I still hate the idea of going to work. I also hate driving there which is a reason why I only take overnight shifts. I don't know why I lack so much discipline when it comes to this, I'm able to stay consistent with things I'm interested in like learning to program, play piano, another language, and exercise. Even when I'm not motivated, I can stay consistent with it, but I seem to have no discipline when it comes to work (Once I'm at work I do work very hard always). 

&amp;#x200B;

I still live with my parents, and I am very grateful to them and for them, but I've been struggling to save money to move out since I hate picking up shifts. Even when I do have enough money to move out, I'm scared that my lack of discipline will mean that I can not afford to stay moved out.  Ideally I would love to somehow work from home doing something I love and not needing to work every single day. I will keep my job until I can somehow manage to get into my ideal situation, I just feel like I lack direction. I'd love any advice on how to reach my goal or actually have some direction or any advice on how to be more disciplined when it comes to this.

She knows I sit alone and has offered for me to join her group of friends at lunch and break. I’m just not confident enough to go up to her and the group of people.

I didn't date/party much at all (had a few flings throughout college and socialized, but didn't have your stereotypical college experience) those years because it wasn't my priority and I was pursuing FIRE (financial independence) in hopes I could travel and spend my time how I want.

I'm at the point where I could stop working and travel, but I've been in a relationship with my gf (25F; she knows what my plans for traveling are) for the past six months and things have been going well. There are a couple of red flags (mental health, promiscuous past), but they haven't been an issue in the time I've been with her.

Basically I'm conflicted in a couple of main ways.

First, I love my gf, but she's also my first legitimate mid/long-term relationship (first love) and I'm worried I'm ignorant/blinded by my lack of dating experience.

Second, I worry if I break things off with my gf and travel for the next few years I'll settle in a city (probably my Midwest hometown) and my dating pool will be more limited. I stay in great shape (lift heavy 5-6 times per week) and I'm financially independent (assets generating my income), and I know I could date down in age but I just don't know how I'd feel being 28 and dating several years younger than me.

I think a lot of my worry comes from the feeling like time is passing by so quickly. I want children in the future and feel like I need to plan accordingly, but I also feel like I sacrificed a lot of my youth in pursuit of this freedom and I have the urge to get back some of those years of youth/dating/partying.

TLDR: I'm financially independent at 25.

The plan is to convert a bus into a mini home and travel the continental US. i'd just take that year to focus on art, study for the MCAT, find doctoral shadowing opportunities, build my resume, and travel. then if the art doesn't work out just sell the bus for, hopefully, a profit and continue school.

I was super relieved when he said he liked me and that he would date me because I felt the same but was too afraid to say it, especially because we had a conversation about dating before (nothing romantic, the subject came out and I mentioned I have never dated in my life) and he said 'never date, it's terrible'. I told him I liked him too and we just kept talking everyday, playing games together, etc and we still do now.

I am a person that gets tired of people extremely fast, and he was the only one that never tired me, I really like talking to him, I love the way he talks about his favorite game, his voice, his sense of humor, I just love everything about him.

However he lives very far away, in another state, and we have been talking for almost 2 years and in this time I have never seen him through video. He has an instagram with a few pictures and a photo on his whats app profile. He always says that he has a shitty phone and the camera doesn't work, and he doesn't have a webcam. There was a moment when I took all this information and made a choice: that I would trust him, and if I was wrong then I would never let myself get involved in a situation like this again.

But I am really suffering right now, because I am 95% sure that I am deeply in love with him and 10% sure he feels the same amount I do. He always messages me first and it's clear that he likes spending time with me, but why the fuck won't he let me see him? If he is playing me why would he waste so much time with me? I really don't understand his actions and this is tearing me apart. 

I tried telling him that I am very sad that I can't see him and everything but he just said 'aww don't be sad' and that was it. I can't keep going like this but I also don't want to loose him. However I understand now that I have to make this choice for my own well being. 

How can I confront him without being too harsh? There is a possibility, even if small, that he may have self esteem problems and I wouldn't like to hurt him, but I also need to put an end to this.

 I do try very hard to be a good person. I want to be a professional actor so it's kind of my job to be empathetic. I am very sensitive to criticism and to people's attitude toward me. When I feel I dislike someone, I try to go out to dinner with them to get to know them and understand them better. Of course, with people I'm closer to, I discuss our mutual friends, their behaviour, and how I feel about them. I'm not trying to be cruel at all, it's simply that people are weird and I like mulling them over in private conversations. Doesn't everyone do that? Legitimately, doesn't everyone have subjective and trivial opinions about everyone else?

I am trying to comprehend a consistent pattern of rejection and isolation in my personal relationships. Because there must be something wrong with me. I grew up very sheltered, I was homeschooled and I've never been part of any kind of group. The few friendships I've made have always evaporated after a few months at most. I really don't want to believe I am inherently unlikeable, but the evidence seems to be pointing that way. I had a meeting with two of the teachers from my school today that has completely shattered my sense of self, and I am at a loss.

I take classes at an acting studio in my city. A few days the head teacher sent me an email asking to have a meeting. I emailed back to ask why, he did not reply. I saw him in person the next day and asked why again, and if I was in trouble. He said we would discuss it soon. Embarrassingly, the looming threat of punishment and the anticipation and the mystery caused me to have a complete fucking breakdown. These classes are extremely important to me and I'm paying a lot of money for them. I tried to get control over my feelings while I sat in the hallway, and had an anxiety attack that lasted for literally 3 hours. I missed my whole class. I told my teacher I was very stressed about the uncertainty and dread of ""having a meeting"" and I needed him to explain clearly what the meeting was for. He did not, I asked another teacher to ask him to please explain over email, and he still did not. So I swallowed the anxiety as best I could, struggled through my next few days of classes, and finally met with him and another teacher today. 

They told me I needed to read the code of conduct for the school again. They told me there had been multiple complaints of me criticizing other student's appearances, acting ability, weight, and age. They told me there had been multiple reports of this over a long period of time, some of them quite serious, and that I had broken the trust of all my classmates. Every one of them had been negatively affected by me. They told me I had to find some way to make reparations and ""ingratiate myself"" to my classmates, or that I would be asked to leave. They told me that the behaviour reported to them was so bad, it would ruin my chances at having an acting career.

I was utterly shocked. No one, not one single person in my class has expressed any of this to me. I thought some of them had maybe acted cold toward me lately, but I assumed that was my own anxiety talking. But no, I have behaved badly enough and caused enough damage that I'm now on probation at my school. I don't remember making any comments like that at all. 

 I asked for examples of course. I was told that I had called one of the teachers a bitch at some point (I have no memory of this, but I suppose its possible. But if so, it would've been in passing, in private conversation, that one of my classmates then reported to my other teachers). The other example was that, one time when some of the staff and all my classmates and I were at the bar for some kind of event, a teacher overheard me making fun of one of my classmate's nose. I asked my teacher if said classmate had told him that he was upset about me making fun of his nose. My teacher replied ""No, but I could tell he was hurt by it."" This particular classmate and I have a pretty good relationship, probably the best I have with anyone in my class. He's boisterous and a little rowdy and we have that sort of banter-y friendship. I've asked him if I've ever gone too far, he told me no. I don't understand why I'm being punished in class for something I said in my own time, casually, at the bar with a friend. 

I am deeply rattled by this, and a little sickened frankly. How on earth did this reach a ""boiling point"" before I even knew there was a problem? I feel almost violated, like someone in my class has been reporting on all my private conversations for months. But I have to take it seriously and make reparations, or I'll be expelled. I'm devastated, I feel sub-human. All my life, relationships have been going horribly wrong and I've been so clueless and so frustrated. I think I must have a major blindspot, but I don't know how I'm supposed to even begin to fix that. 

I feel like every bit of paranoia I've ever had has been confirmed by what I was told at this meeting. Everyone actually does dislike me, I am actively fucking everything up, and people legitimately don't want me around. The amount of anxiety I feel is astronomical, and I worry that I'm doomed to a life of overthinking, worrying, and being totally indecisive in every single social situation going forward.  I feel almost hopeless, but maybe this is something I can fix.

i graduated college right before the pandemic hit and i was 21 years old. i had plans to possibly move away for my graduate program but those were tossed when the shelter in place orders were put in. now, i am about to finish my graduate program (getting a master's degree in the US) but i have been focusing on work with my dad as well. as of now i have no real plans after graduation but to work full time at my dad's (small) practice.

of course i love my dad and i want to support him the best i can. however i feel like i am losing myself more and more and that i am only holing myself in more by reducing my life to work at my dad's company. i have few friends outside of work, i cannot relate with my classmates, and i have no motivations or optimism for the future. i feel like i am stagnating and i havent felt like i have been maturing along the way outside of my academic progression.

there are no complaints about the actual work in staying with my dad but i just feel like its not my calling the way i felt in pursuing my master's, nor is it the field i want to be in. each time something goes wrong in his practice or an employee leaves, and so on, i am expected to patch up the hole that was left, and i don't feel like i have a choice anymore but to be that person. the longer this goes on the more worried i get that i won't ever be able to emerge as fully independent and be able to say i actually worked for my money and my life. i am also afraid of breaking my dad more, as i am very familiar with how difficult it already is to manage his company.

has anyone gone through something similar or have any advice? i have spoken to my closest friends about this but i dont want to keep complaining to them about the same issues. thank you",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,29099,public,self,help with career/future,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t7rfwa/help_with_careerfuture/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,

tldr: should i go abroad and leave my bf and my cat? 

so i have an opportunity to go abroad within this year. it's for work, but if i  would be able to save up some money, i might also get to study. or, i may also be able to move to another country, to fulfill my dream of travelling to different countries around the world.
i really want to do something in my life that i would be proud of someday. ever since i was younger, i've been wanting to take the risk and just go abroad and live the nomad life alone.
all my friends are in college, and i'm so sick and tired of being jealous that we can't afford it, and i'm sick and tired of my family &amp; relatives  comparing me to other people my age, or them waiting for me to do something that lives up to the potential they thought i have, and then obviously getting disappointed. damn, i am so sick and tired of getting disappointed at myself.
my life has just been a series of disappointment since high school, and so as time goes by, i am slowly hiding and isolating myself. i am ashamed  because my cousins/friends/schoolmates, are all doing well in their jobs and universities, whereas i am stuck at home, with no job + not in college + depression. 
but anyway, i do have an opportunity now to redeem myself and escape this series of disappointments. and it's what i've been wanting to do ever since!

BUT... that means i would have to leave my boyfriend and my cat.

first, my boyfriend. he's been my best-est friend during all of this hard times, he supported me through all my ups and downs, and he's been the person that i've always leaned on to. and heck, i'd marry him any day.
but he can't come because he's still in college. and i'm afraid that we might break up because if i'm being honest, i might never go back. 

second, my cat. please don't think this is petty, my cat is so important to me. he is my best friend too. i took care of him since he was born and he's never known a life without me being there for him every minute of every day. wherever i go, he goes too. he sleeps beside me, sits on my lap everyday, looks for me when i'm not in sight, wants me to carry him all the time, and licks my tears when i cry. he can even make me laugh with his silly antics. he's so so clingy and he would make loud noises when he can't see me. he is kinda aggressive to everybody else, and doesn't even want my mom to carry him.

i'm having a hard time deciding if i would go, especially because of my cat. i don't know where he should stay once i'm gone, and i know he would be so stressed looking for me. 
but i also know that a cat's life is very short compared to humans and i can't base my decisions, that would impact my whole life, on him.

he's sleeping on my lap right now as i'm writing this. and looking at him right now, i just want to cuddle with him and stay with him forever.

but time goes on, and i am only growing older. and i haven't done anything with my life. i'm terrified of being old and dissatisfied doing nothing with my life. even if i put this ""going abroad"" off for a year, my bf and my cat would still be there making it hard for me to go.

if i stay here, i wouldn't ever afford to go to college. i would always only be qualified for low wage jobs, and living a life of poverty like the rest of my family is definitely not a dream of mine. 

what do you think should i do?

My brothers are high up in their company and can easily get me a job. The only downside is my work commute would go from 5 minutes 30 minutes. Which 30 minutes isn’t really a big deal. My biggest worry is not liking the job or the work environment compared to my current job. Although I make such little money at my current job that I’ll never be able to achieve my dreams such as moving out of my parents house being independent ect.

from april 2021 to december 2021, i went through a horribly bad depressive episode where i lost friends, hobbies, interests, my personality, my passions, etc.

as i exit this depressive episode, i’m finding myself slipping back into the shoes of this old persona, and quite frankly- it feels nice. i feel like the old me again, the me i liked- but a lot more confident, as i’ve been through the worst and made it out alive, and well.

but i can’t help but wonder- am i wrong for this? we as a society talk so much about “letting go” and “moving on”, and if i come back to who i was before depression, does that mean i’m regressing instead of healing?

it feels like my brain is sort of “switching back to its regularly scheduled programming”. like there was an interruption on my journey as a person but i’m back to being on the path of who i’m meant to be.

but i can’t help but wonder- am i supposed to be forever changed from everything that’s happened to me? is it wrong of me to be my old self again? am i supposed to be a new person? what the hell am i supposed to step into, if so?

the person i’ve always considered “me” is an artistic musical person who loves nature and the world and finds the beauty in small things- a person who is extremely passionate about everything and always has energy. i lost him from depression, but i’m starting to feel like him again. but is this wrong? am i not allowed to be him anymore? am i supposed to move on? moving on feels wrong. just typing this feels wrong. but i have a hard time telling the difference between anxiety &amp; intuition.

so, do i move away from the old me and onto a new me, or move forward with who i am and what i’ve learned, i guess is my question.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,29094,public,self,am i allowed to regress or do i move foward?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t7jjup/am_i_allowed_to_regress_or_do_i_move_foward/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,

I had a very rough 2021. 

I lost everything I had, my beautiful girlfriend and our future plans, my rented condo, my jobs and my mental health has suffered.

I’m currently sitting in a discounted hotel room with my dog, a can of beans and my business plans and dreams to succeed.

I just snapped out of a terrible depression which lasted nearly 7 months. 

Maybe it was the spring, fresh air and sunshine.

So I’m starting over with a little debt, big plans and $0.04 in my bank account. I’m not sure what I’ll eat tomorrow. I sold everything I had to survive to this point.

Today I woke up and snapped out of my rut. I’ve been busy all day trying to get another job and money for my start up. I want to work on my dream again.  

I only have a coach bag that is sentimental that my ex bought me for my birthday and a Movado Bold I bought myself after my divorce to remind me that time is our most valuable asset.

Both are valuable but sentimental to me and I will take them with me.

I need a small business startup loan ASAP to get my new business venture up and running.

I am an entrepreneur who ran a successful tree business for 7 years before it fell apart after an injury.

I want to expand my business model to include more services and hire qualified employees.

I tried the government of Canada website for a small business loan.

I need something ASAP. Any avenue to get back on my feet.

In terms of everything else, I pray everyday for that woman back in my life. 

To be what I once was and to succeed.

Has anyone else been in this position? 

I’m not suicidal, I would have done it by now. 

I want to have more hope and inspiring stories from others who have spring-boarded off the bottom.

I’d like to stop washing my clothes in a bathtub and get some real food in me. I’d also like to take my dog for a nice grooming, she needs some love.

Weed doesn’t usually help me but it’s what I went to, because that’s what other people do to numb the pain or whatever, and yesterday I overdosed.

I recently just started having a crush on a girl except a few years ago I used to have this good female friend who I may have had a few feelings for. The ex friend used to be my bestest friend and my go-to talking buddy until her mentality started spiraling down, causing her to be more manipulative, suicidal, and overall self-destructive. I told one of my other friends about this and he said if he could talk to her to try and help her out, she eventually talked to me saying ""You weren't supposed to tell anyone about it"" (note she never stated anything about keeping it secret). After that event she stopped talking to me to the point of me feeling guilty enough to cut her and everyone off of my social life, and became a social outcast. That isolation caused me to want to stay alone forever until I met a girl in class who I then started to have feelings for, however a part of my thinks it'll just go down the drain like it did last time.

I am 26 years old, and long story short, I’ve got some problems with my view of life itself, I guess.
I don’t really know how it materialised and how I got here, but I’ve got massive problems identifying myself with my past. In fact, it sounds good, like this all-hyped ‘live in the moment’ stuff you always hear. And that works fine, tbh. But it also has the massive downside of not being able to be proud of anything I achieved, and objectively there’s a lot (like in everyones life).

I don’t want to acknowledge it emotionally, but rationally the idea of determinism makes massive sense to me (unfortunately, as it really spikes my anxiety and makes me feel powerless and tired). That really is one of the reasons for this. Currently, it does not really affect my thoughts about my future (I don’t really think about it, it let it come), but as you can imagine, it makes me think that everything that happened in the past was a product of mere physics. My decisions were not *my* decisions, but the product of chemical processes in my head and body paired with sensations from the “outside” world.

It does not affect me massively, like, I like my life and I can be genuinely happy. But because of internalized this belief it does intuitively not make any sense to me to plan anything that goes beyond 24hrs. It’s seriously hard for me. Also, as said, I do not really think about past events. They hapenned as they have. Good things are not my achievement but were meant to be, as are the bad things.

I don’t like this. I want to be able to identify with all the things I achieved, all the friends I’ve made, and want to make big plans for at least the next months (like holidays, travelling, financially, etc.)

I don’t know where to start to work on this. Like, I cannot find any hard evidence against determinism in the first place. Maybe the out of this is not trying to disprove determinism but another one.
If anyone has suggestions, books, any other help, I’d appreciate it! &lt;3 Thanks in advance!",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,29090,public,self,"Not able to identify with my past, or my future",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t78qyf/not_able_to_identify_with_my_past_or_my_future/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,

I also understand that sexuality isn't a choice and I am against harming them and I support their basic human rights it is just that I can't support gay marriage for religious reasons yet I still respect their marriage and don't judge it or interfere with their relationship and I accept their marriage 

But a gay friend took me as a punch bag and humilited me for this...but as long as I am respecting everyone, sexualities and choices with their lives and won't try to harm anyone then why did I get bullied?

I got a response the next morning from a Honda dealership. I’ve been wanting a car sales job for years, as I love sales and wanted to be in direct customer contact with big pay out. 

My interview went incredible, they loved me and the store manager stopped it twice to invite in other managers (the GM and finance manager) to listen to my answers because he’d “never heard them before.”

They offered me a weekly salary ($200+ of what I bring home now) plus uncapped commission- although its draw against commission. The hours are of course, rough and would vary looking something like 9-5, 10-7, 9-7, off, 9-6, 9-5.

I don’t believe Saturday is negotiable, as I asked and only one person doesn’t work Saturday’s and I didn’t ask the reasoning. I’m kicking myself for not being more adamant that I’m not interested in working them. But is it worth throwing away the offer and staying miserable for significantly less money?

tw Self harm

For reference I am 15M and my brother is 18M

I self harmed for 3 months because of staying with an abusive relative in another country, came back to my home country and kept doing it for another 3 months. I only quit because I was ruining all my boxers by bleeding on them and didn't want to keep losing them. Needless to say it was the best decision of my life because I quickly learned to cope with other healthier methods and I am way happier now. But tomorrow me and my brother are going on a walk, and I was planning to tell him what I was doing because we're extremely close and we tell each other everything. He's like my best friend, no matter what I put him above everything. He is the most important person in my life and always listens to my problems and my hobbies with such patience and understanding. Whenever I'm about to tell him a secret he always asks me ""Is it life threatening?"" aka ""Are you shing?"" and I always tell him no, and I always feel really guilty for lying after, because I know he's 100% honest with me. I feel like he deserves to know but I really don't want to burden him with this information. I feel like it would traumatize him, or ruin our relationship because I was lying to him for so long and just now decided to tell him, a month after I actually quit. I feel like he won't trust me again, or will never see me the same way. (Sidenote: I have a history of self harm, this is the third time I relapsed but it is easily the worst because it went on actively for so long.)

I am invested in some cryptos I think could make me some good money.

On top of all that, I've pushed away most of my friends and basically every women that was ever into me (even super hot women who have thrown themselves at me) due to trauma. I did rebuild some of the friendships, and made some new ones.

over half the rent, living with my father, in highschool.

I (M) live with my father and just turned 18. I work at a grocery store making 10 dollars an hour. Because of my 18th b day, my dad’s living expenses have changed drastically. He was previously getting 300 a month from social security, and a disability check, and child support payments. Since i turned 18, he lost that 300, and the child support payments. The worst financial support we could possibly lose however, is our rental assistance. If I start making much more money than I do now, we will lose it, and I will have to pay over half the rent. I just recently learned that the store I work at is closing. There are a lot of job offers I have got to be making some serious money as a high schooler, which makes this whole situation even worse. I don’t know what to do. I want to make more money and get more quality work experience in for the future, but I am being held back. I guess my question is, what do I do? I know moving out is an option, but I know it’s expensive, and usually recommended to me by many to live with your parents for as long as possible.

Originally posted on r/CUboulder as that is where I go to school 

I want to start off by saying I love CU, I am a freshman guy and until now everything about freshman year has been amazing. I love my classes, have made great friends and met my current girlfriend who is amazing. I might also add that I graduated in 2020 and I couldn’t wait to get out of my small town and come here but I had to take a gap year because of Covid, making me a year older than most of my friends. 

Anyways, in the beginning of the year everything was awesome! I’m from CO so I was introduced to a few people along with the people I already knew from high school. I met everyone that would talk to me and made an amazing friend group, we would do everything together from wine Wednesday’s in the dorms to “family dinners” at the dining hall. When I got here the Greek life was a lot bigger than I had expected, I had never really thought about joining a frat until one of my friends brought me around a frat that I thought I would really enjoy. I loved all the guys they seemed very close and genuine unlike some of the other frats I’ve seen here. So me and  my guy friends decided to all rush - we all got bids and started pledging, I won’t go into detail about why I dropped but it wasn’t anything hazing or pledge related at all ( I want to emphasize this as I did genuinely want to join this frat) but I dropped a few weeks before initiation. At the same time as I was pledging I met my current gf who is awesome and supported me in every way. I thought that not much would change after I dropped but I guess I was wrong. 

We are around halfway through 2nd semester and I have never felt so bored/ alone before. As I mentioned I come from a small town and I am used to being alone (especially through Covid and a gap year) but this is different. All my friends (guys and girls) are in Greek life and I feel like I don’t get to do anything anymore. I used to look forward to the weekends and going out but I have only been to one party at the frat I pledged at and was given weird looks and less than friendly treatment by the brothers. My friends in the frat tell me it’s okay to come to the party’s but I feel like a +1 that the hosts don’t like, so I don’t go anymore. My girlfriend goes out with our girlfriends religiously every Thursday, Friday and Saturday leaving me to turn to my guy friends who are normally not doing anything if they aren’t at the frat. So most weekends I sit alone in my dorm while all my friends are out posting on their story’s and then come back to my dorm late at night, drunk and happy while I have been sitting alone getting high for the last few hours. It is a different type of lonely, to see all your friends doing fun things on the weekend and all I can do it watch. I try not to be bitter about it but it’s really starting to get to me after so many lonely nights. I do my best to be social with new people and try and find new friends that aren’t all about Greek life but I have had so such luck. Im definitely joining the free ride club next year but outside of that I don’t really see myself wanting to join any other new organizations. I try to go skiing as much as possible and I just got a new job that has kept me a bit busier but it’s still the same thing every Friday and Saturday night, me alone with some weed and family guy. I am used to these kinds of weekend nights - I will openly admit I am not a huge party guy, but this is different - everyone that I have grown close with over the year gets to go out and have the time of their lives and I hear ALL about it but I am never included in these memories and fun nights. 

I feel very disconnected from them now, among other things, the friend group just isn’t the same for me anymore. As I’ve said I’ve been trying to make new friends but it never gets anywhere and this is all really starting to get to me. I don’t need to party all the time but I have nothing to look forward to on the weekends anymore, it would be nice if I could go out with them just one night every other week but I can’t even get that. I don’t know, maybe I’m just wining about something stupid but it’s starting to make me feel depressed. I don’t want this to come off as “I’m sad bc I can’t party” -that’s not it at all. It’s the fact that I sit alone every weekend with nothing but my thoughts while the people I am closest to are all gone. I just want something fun to do with friends on the weekends, it doesn’t need to be crazy but I’m tired of feeling alone in a friend group full of people I love and care about.

It seemed like from the time they were together, to when they separated when I was 18, they weren’t romantically involved.

I’m 17 and an absolute loser. This isn’t hyperbole - I’ve spent most of my life wasting away in my bedroom with no will to live and not a single friend. I’m an edgy, hyper-critical douchebag who crumbles when shown even the slightest sign of affection. I realise that this is my own doing, and I’m not sure where to go from here; the only thing keeping me going is a slight flicker of hope that things will improve. I will preface this by saying that I’ve been diagnosed with depression and PTSD by a doctor in the past few years, but it doesn’t really affect me. My ‘depression’ is merely just a realistic outlook, and my PTSD rarely even comes up. I’m in therapy. 

I’ve always had in my mind that I was a victim to some extent, whilst the rest was my own doing, but I never knew how awful I was. I was walking through college today mentally tearing apart everyone I looked at, mocking any girls for wearing makeup and wanting to look nice, and laughing at any boys for taking themselves so seriously. I am a genuinely terrible person and while I don’t take it out on others (mainly because I can go days without talking to anyone and at least try to be polite when I do), there is no denying that at my core, I am a narcissistic bully obsessed with putting others down.

The worst part is that I don’t want to change. I take pride in who I am and being so far off from the norm. I’ve tried so, so hard to rack my brain and set myself on the right path, but I just can’t. When presented with past opportunities to change, I rejected them in favour of living like this. I was wondering on how to accept this? I’ve spent so long wishing for a better life but it’s just not going to happen. Again, I am seeing a therapist - a good one, to boot - but nothing she says can get through to me. Again, I realise how awful I am, and that’s not going to increase my chance of getting help from others, but this is the only place I have left to turn to.

We have been together for nearly a year and we both come from the same town in England. 

However, we currently live 300 miles away from each other: he is based in Scotland for work and I am completing my PGCE in England. 

I love him to pieces and I am grateful that we get to see each other fortnightly (Friday night-Sunday afternoon) as he catches a plane and a train down to my accommodation. I always wish we could spend more time together. 

My course ends in June and I will become a qualified English teacher and I will be able to teach anywhere in England. 

He is hoping to leave his job in Scotland next year and train to become a paramedic, a six year course, in the English region in which I am currently studying (an hour away from our home town). 

I am entertaining three options (I have tried to weigh them up equally below) that I would like honest opinions on:

1. I take a job at my placement school in my study region and rent alone for a year. This means that when my partner moves down to England next year, I have a job and steady wage so we can move in together elsewhere in my study region. I am afraid of being lonely as whilst I love my school, I am not enamoured with the city or the flat that I would rent and I don’t feel that I have made permanent friends.

2. I move back home to live with my family and teach in my home town. I can save money, be in a place I know well and I will have company, an important factor for me. It also removes his train journey, so saves money there but I may feel like I have no independence or space. This would mean that I would have a considerable commute (up to an hour) when we move to my study region the following year. 

3. I move up to Scotland so we can find a place to rent together for a year and instead of teaching full time, I increase my hours of online tutoring. I have been promised regular tutoring hours which means I would be able to afford my half of the rent. Living here would allow me to be with my partner, give me more time to read, cook and exercise and I do love the city where he stays. However, he can be away for work for up to six weeks at a time. As a result, I may be living alone 300 miles away from my family and I would not be earning as much as I would as a full-time teacher. It also means that when we leave Scotland after a year, I would have to find a job in my current study region which may be stressful. 

My partner is very supportive and neutral and he wants me to do what is best for me; he has helped me to compile an honest pros and cons list for all locations. 

My parents are supportive but feel very strongly that taking a job at my placement school/taking a job at home are ‘sensible decisions’ and that Scotland is ‘a mistake’. 

I do understand where they are coming from and I am torn about whether I should make a sensible choice to lay down the roots for myself and my partner (at the risk of potentially being unhappy) or move up to Scotland for a year to have some time to refine my teaching practice and be with my partner but potentially be isolated if he is away.

Well just to get straight into this like the title says I'm turning 20 in a few days and to be honest I just feel lost. I'm currently attending community College even though school is not my thing and I work with my Step parent for his small business. Having an immigrant italian family I'm always looked down upon since I take work more serious than school. But to be honest now I'm starting to question everything I am doing. Life, school, work, idk I'm just not happy to be honest and everyone around me basically just gives me the ""deal with it"" ""I had it harder"" speech. I have no clue what I wanna do with my life, I'm lucky enough to have this family business but I'm not even sure I wanna do that for the rest of my life. Everyday it feels like I wake up and do the same thing, almost like I'm trapped in this fog and will be forever. I'm more so posting this to just get it off my chest as I have no one around me who I can speak to about this. If I tell my mother this stuff she basically tells me she's worried I'm gonna be a ""bum"". I do work hard, sometimes I'm working 6-7 days a week from 7 am to 4 pm doing manual labor but like I said idk if this is for me. I guess I'm just looking for any advice that anyone has out there. 

Just a side note I live in NY and I love it here as it's just my home. But I cannot live with my mother and stepfather anymore it drives me crazy. I'm basically constantly told I'm doing everything wrong. I'm not one of these people who wants a huge house and a expensive car, I'm happy with a 2 bedroom apartment and taking the train everywhere I just fear I'll be trapped here with them forever because I'm lost in life.

 I am a 23M dropped out not too long ago just a year before i would've graduated, currently working part time 20hrs a week in a min wage job. I made 5 figures in crypto this year, which covered alot of student debt, however I since deleted all my crypto exchange accounts and turned off notifications for all crypto stuff as I didnt see it as a good way to focus my time.

I now value my time alot and don't want to work more than 40hrs/week because last time it left me resenting work and feeling depressed for a long time.

I now realize how important friendships are. I don't think I am very social but at my work I find myself talking to people and socializing more than working because I enjoy it so much. It was because of covid that I found this out and I no longer see my friends that often because we all live like an hour away from each other however we do talk in groupchats everyday.

I live at home and my family bought a breed of dog (7months old) that needs intense exercise (2hr walks) and lots of stimulation all day, for which I am primary provider of and if I am not here he wont get the exercise he needs and I carry that guilt with me all day which makes me feel like shit.

I have a gf who is finding lots of success in her career and shes going to be moving in her own house soon, which I could be moving into as well but I just don't have enough monthly income to justify it, however I really want to move in with her and get my life going.

I guess i have always been a very ambitious person I have started a few side businesses that have worked a bit and failed or I just gave up on it because I didn't find it worth while anymore, but that leads me to why I am here today.

# Decisions Decisions.....

I need to make a decision.... and to me this decision feels very important in the trajectory of my life, so i guess i am looking for second opinions.

**Option 1**, I have the option to become a certified Trainer and then apply to some jobs at gyms around here however the demanding schedule of a trainer requires you to be available 5am-7pm. As much as I like fitness and how I have been successful with gf friends and family and helping them get to their goals idk if I want to have my schedule that occupied. This would be good because I know I would do well and likely move up in company very fast plus I would have the monthly income to move in with gf and I would be able to socialize everyday. Negatively, I could be taking the short term opportunity here and maybe if I waited a little longer one of the opportunities below would've lined up, plus I would also not have any time to take care of my dog.

**Option 2**, I currently am running ads to sign up clients so I can train them in my area, however that also takes a bunch of time and mental stamina and money. The benefit of this is if I can get it off the ground before I run out of money it could be very rewarding, however it will take alot of time to get it to the place where I earn enough to move out with gf. This feels very isolating to me, as I wouldn't have any coworkers to socialize with for a while. 

**My third option** is more outlandish and involves me not getting paid at all except I would meet cool people and those connections could possibly rocket launch my career.

I want to cold email a few people I find really interesting and find a creative way that I could help them save time with their tasks and they don't pay me anything they just show me how they work and what they do, like an unpaid intern. Once again this will take at least a few months and I wont make any money right away and nothing is guaranteed, however I could make important friendships along the way. This would be amazing for socializing because I have so many questions and I am genuinely eager to learn from a select few individuals that I admire and it seems like alot of fun, however its definetly a weird one to explain to family at holiday dinners though.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk why but for the first time in my life I feel like taking any hourly job for me personally is a sellout and I will regret it.

I'll provide some background--
I'm 26(f) and recently graduated from a university in December of 2020, it was during the height of the pandemic, so it was a pretty underwhelming feeling despite the fact that it was supposed to be one of the most profound moments in my life, anyways... I graduated with a BS in human services with a concentration in mental health counseling, it wasn't until a couple of years into my degree that I realized that I'd have to enroll into grad school if I'd ever want to make some real money and do something that I was interested in. 
I'd also just gotten together with the love of my life and hopefully future husband in March of 2020 and officially moved in in February of 2021 (although I was always at his place prior to that so it was like I had been living with him for much longer). After I graduated and finished my internship, I was unemployed and trying desperately to find somewhere to work to be able to contribute to our home, my boyfriend was the one who was paying pretty much everything, I'd try to help financially any way I could, but it wasn't really a whole lot. I knew that I had to find something soon so I could stop feeling like a financial burden. He has never made me feel bad or guilty for doing that and has supported me through my tough times, however, I still feel guilty for having to rely so heavily on him. After countless resumes and applications being sent in, and after several emails declining me, I'd finally found something in early July 2021. 
Fast forward to now, I am still at this job as a Lasik technician, I essentially preform testing on patients to determine their candidacy for the Lasik procedure, I talk to them about finances, I'm in charge of scheduling appointments, working in the operating room etc. etc...
I'm finally getting to the point where I'm hating my job, I've always struggled with depression and anxiety as a person, but this position has caused it to worsen significantly. The job itself isn't horrible but compared to most of my coworkers; I'm being moved around from center to center much more often, am having to work more late days than others, my schedule gets changed around every single week, and I'm having to pick up the slack even more now that one of my coworkers just quit without any notice. 
And to top it off, it's becoming a trend that our leadership team has been treating us like children rather than grown adults when they talk to us in a very passive aggressive way and has been showing little to no compassion when it comes to our concerns, this also goes for the higher ups as well who expect perfection from us while also never acknowledging if they've done something wrong. I've also made it clear to them that I have a disability and have a really bad knee so I can't be in the operating room as much as some of my other coworkers, there are screws in my knee and standing on concrete for 10 hours a day sometimes without even a break for lunch really messes it up and incapacitates me for the whole next day.
I recently brought this up to my leadership team and the higher ups saying that the favoritism is rampant, there are employees who get to pick and choose which center they're at every day because they live close by, they get to sit up at the front desk and do little to no work, and never have any questions asked if they need to leave early/get sick.  
I've had just enough of this job and want to quit desperately, my boyfriend is 100% on board with me leaving saying that the job makes me miserable and that he's sad seeing me this way, and while I agree, there are still a few things holding me back.
The job pays a decent amount because of the monthly bonuses we receive (although the company is always trying to take them from us for any little reason), I had a free Lasik procedure here with the understanding that if I left before a year was up, then I'd have to pay my procedure back at a pro-rated rate, I don't have another job lined up currently, and I do not want to be a financial burden on my boyfriend again. 
I'm so insanely torn because I'm feeling my mental health just plummeting, I'm not happy anymore and I'm downright tired, my boyfriend is my absolute rock and has no issues taking care of me, but I just feel like I cannot do that to him again. I'm also weary of the money I'm going to have to pay back to this company if I do quit, and I'm also afraid that it's going to take me a long time to find somewhere that'll hire me that pays as much as this place does. Please help? I'm so sorry that this was a long post. Thank you all in advance.

He shrugged it off and I told my mom immediately and her reaction was ""he probably thought that I was showering and wanted to see me"" even though he knew I was the one showering and even then it's weird that he'd be outside trying to see his wife like some sort of wierdo. 
After this I was very distant with my dad and was trying to find a way to bring up the topic again with my mom. My dad would randomly bring up the topic of ghosts and spirits in the house to cast the blame on the house being haunted and that it wasn't him I saw. 
After a few days of mental torture and deliberation I finally worked up the courage to talk to my mom about it. She told me she doesn't want to believe my dad would be capable of such a thing and that she would be a mother before she would be wife. She also asked me if I wanted her to ask him about it and I told her no. 2 days later she comes to my room to tell me she asked him about it despite what I said and she said he insisted it wasn't him. In the end she chose to believe his word against mine and it broke my heart. 
I thought about past experiences with my dad to see if there was any suspicious behavior that I may have overlooked when I was younger. I recalled that my dad would always need to use the bathroom when I was showering. We always have had 2 bathroom and he would always go to the one I was in. I also recall other details but it all build down to the same thing. I would mentally be angry with myself for being so ignorant and not realizing sooner that his behavior was odd but then I remember that I was just a daughter trusting her father. If I had to give an age as to when i remember his suspicious behavior I would say since I went through puberty so 12/14. 
I am now 20 years old and I ran away from home a couple months ago and I still keep in contact with my parents and I honestly don't know what to do about how I handle my relationship with them. My dad still doesn't think he did anything wrong and I honestly believe he may feel so guilty by his own actions he chooses to believe his own lie. And I am upset that my mom believes him over me after saying she's be a mom first. There are other serious conflicts I've had with them but this one is the one that concerns me most right now. Any advice? Am i maybe looking too hard into it?

I understand that. And I'm more than willing. I never meant to offend anyone.

I'm a white male, but I never in my dreams would want to offend anyone. I work at a public library, and I've put my foot in my mouth three times in last week. I've been there about 8 months now without incident.

The first time, my supervisor was messing with a lock. I was ADD growing up, medicated, and I found that ever since I went off my medication years ago that I have less of a filter. She switched the lock around the correct way, and I blurted out without thinking, ""Oh, nice job. Your IQ just went up 10 points.""

I didn't mean it to be hurtful, and my supervisor is someone that I greatly respect and don't think poorly of at all. I just don't goddamn think, and I'm way too interested in being liked and funny. I actually meant it to come out of my head like, ""Oh, XXX, you're already smarter than me and now your IQ went up even higher!"" But that's what came out. I swear. I just don't goddamn think. Her and another coworker acknowledged it and moved on. I was so embarrassed with myself, I just froze and let the moment pass.

I then, before closing last week, told a travel story that was slightly racially tinged. Didn't even consider it to be a problem. Because someone asked about my experiences in Canada. The story revolved around a waitress I met just below the Alaskan border. When asked if there was anything interesting in town, she responded that there was a Spanish festival in town with ""real Mexicans"". I live and work in Southern California. I stressed when I told the story that it was odd just because of meeting said racist person. Well, apparently someone complained. I'm not sure what the complaint was, but they did. I suppose I shouldn't have told a racial story at all. That was so incredibly stupid of me.

On top of that, this same supervisor misconstrued a comment I made last week to another coworker of being unsupportive of her potential promotion, which I had no response to. I remember the comment, and it was completely the opposite. Not only do I want her to get the promotion, I've told her as much many times before. I genuinely do. So, I'm not really sure what I did there other than make my manager doubt my sincerity to such a point.

Basically, I've shoved my foot into my mouth 3 times within a week at my workplace. This manager now understandably doesn't like me. She was noticeably different in demeanor and politely short the entire time. I apologized profusely and told her I never meant to insult anyone, including her. I asked if there was anything for follow up, and she said there wasn't. Just that she'd be sending me an email to confirm we talked. And, that I want to keep it. I'm unsure if that means HR isn't involved? I have no idea. She basically just stressed that I need to stop joking, and that some people that ""don't know me"" may take things offensively. It was the most embarrassing moment of work in my life.

Basically, I feel horrible. I feel like I never want to step foot in that place again. And speaking as it's my first job ever in my career field, I feel like I've made unforgivable mistakes. I never wanted to offend anyone. And now my managers (the one that I've mentioned will surely tell my others if they don't already know) will all hate me. I won't be getting letters of recommendation after this, so I'm not sure what point there is in continuing to work there. And I've never wanted to offend anyone. And I've become the world's biggest screwup.

How do I move forward from this?

I worked at my hometown hardware store for 5 years as management. I worked with my mom and after a big breakup she chose my exes side rather than me and I ended up leaving because of her. I loved the line of work, I loved everything about my job and it paid extremely well. It was however, a small hometown family owned store - basically a dead end. I left and went to work for a bank where I once again enjoyed the work, but found myself struggling to work well with the management there. The entire staff had an issue with the lead manager and it just made the workplace uncomfortable. After a bout with covid I left there after 3ish months. 

I now work for an even smaller power equipment company. Much more my line of work but I’m feeling underwhelmed. It’s too slow of a pace for me and almost too narrow of a line? I really like the staff as people (it’s me and two other males, mid 30s) however the manager is way too egotistical and plain rude to customers and I don’t appreciate it. I’ve been here since October (so 5ish months) and I feel like after busy season I’ll need another job.

I’m feeling like I’m failing, again, and I don’t know where I should look next. I guess this is more of a vent? Any recs on good fields? I’m big on sales, customer service. Just feeling lost.

What should I do? Bf of 4 years broke up with me and I feel awful.

I have no idea what to do.

Hi. Yesterday my boyfriend of 4 years broke up with me. I’m a female (30) he’s a male (33) and we met when I was 25 at work. It was an instant connection and we started going out and dating for a year and a half. Fast forward to September 2019, he broke up with me. We had a lot of problems 

(I was jealous since he was very flirty with other girls and didn’t accept responsibility). We broke up over the phone because he didn’t want me to make a scene., said he was tired of my depression/ anxiety and that he wanted a partner, not a pacient from a psychiatric facility. (Exact words). I called and wrote, never got an answer. 
10 months got by until June 2020 and in the middle of the pandemic I called several times, we talked a lot and got along pretty well so we started dating again. He moved in with me for 4 months (until he got angry one day, broke up with me, took all his things and moved with his dad). That lasted for a day until he called again and said it was a mistake. 
On December 2021 he said he had been keeping a secret from me, that when we got back together he had just broken up with the only girl he ever fell in love with and had spent the last two years missing her and longing for her although the whole time he was with me. He said he knew how much I’m worth and he’s angry at himself that he can’t fall desperately in love with me. Even with this, I forgave him and we stayed together. The last month and a half things really improved, he was caring, nice, respectful, attentive, made me feel secure and loved. Last week we were talking to a friend of his that gave us some information to move abroad since this is both our dream. It will be really hard for me and I have a really narrow possibility since I’m a lawyer and I can’t work as such in other countries. I received that day some scary news regarding my health, so I felt really frustrated with life for a day or two until it passed. He got super angry with me and over the weekend was extremely cold and distant. On Sunday he left for a couple hours saying “he had to take care of personal stuff that he couldn’t tell me about since I don’t approve of many things” so I had no idea what that was about ( I always worry it’s about another girl since he cheated once on me 2 years ago and the last comment of the girl it took two years to forget). I snapped and tell him that and he left. 
He called yesterday to break up with me for good. He says he doesn’t want to be with me anymore, is fed up with me and my pessimism and negative outlook on life, is tired of being my psychologist and if he wants to build a life he can’t do it with someone like me. We had a trip next week and he cancelled my ticket saying he’ll go alone. I called several times but he said there’s nothing else to talk about, we’ll never talk again and will never get back together. I’m thinking about going to his house and talking to him but I don’t know what I should do. He’s the love of my life and the most amazing person I’ve ever met. He’s strong, smart, incredibly intelligent, focused and many more things. I can’t stand the thought of losing him forever (I know he’ll never reach out and never talk  to me again). I can’t believe I screwed this up again, I feel so guilty for being like this and wishing I was the person he wanted to be with. 
I’m sorry, I haven’t eaten or slept and I can’t help but feeling a huge void in my chest and anxiety over the roof. I can’t believe last week we eres so happy and talking about marriage and the future and now he’s gone and never wants to hear from me again. Don’t know what to do at all. I feel really bad I fed him up with my negative things, but I’m being honest when I say I really really tried and was really nice and understanding with him.
I know I can be too much, I know it’s hard to be with someone with mental health issues (and I’ve been and still am in therapy) but he said I’m not improving fast enough. I know I brought up doubts and fears regarding girls because of what happened and my insecurities pushed him away.

I'm from an immigrant family and I'm the eldest daughter whose the first to go to college. When I was in middle school, I really thought I wanted to pursue writing since it was the one thing I was good at, the one thing I held onto when things were rough. I decided to put my efforts towards science when my parents weren't on the same page as me. After a little while, the things they wanted for me became what I wanted, until now.

I've replayed the scene in my head millions of times and I don't think I can see them in pain because of me. Because I can't accomplish their dream. I've been seriously thinking about writing again, but I'm scared. I think part of the reason is that if I commit to writing, I know I'll put my whole heart into it. If my plan doesn't work out or if I'm not a good writer as I think I am, I'll have regrets, but I also regret not standing up to my parents in the first place. Publishing isn't easy to do and there isn't any guarantee of money wise and that's what my parent's main concern is. They don't want me to financially struggle because they've been through it. I want to do both so I can go to medical school and pursue my passion for writing. It's really hard though. Classes take up most of my time and I'm not smart enough to keep up with both. I've written one manuscript. It was pretty bad but I was proud I had written my first one. I have a good idea for a second that I think has potential but knowing how exhausting classes are, I'll never get to writing it till the summer. Who knows, I might never get to it all.

So I finished half my Associate's Degree yeras ago but well, life got in the way. I've been employed nonstop since I was 21, starting in sales but for the past few years working mostly in customer retention/de-escalations, managing high-level customer accounts and what not (been working for the same online company for 8+ years now). I'd like to think I have a pretty solid resume, and I do pretty well salary wise. With that being said, I feel kind of limited without having a degree.  Like, there maybe job opporunities that I'm not going to be eligible for, or even in a social sense, like there's still so much stigma towards people who dont have degrees. IDK I guess I feel kinda insecure in that way?  Additionally, I do want to move to a new city where there is a potentially higher cost of living. Kinda want a new start.

&amp;#x200B;

But going back to school at this age/income means having to take out loans, which I'm scared to death of because I've always taken care of my credit and I average at about 780-820 with only like 3k in credit card debt that I""m paying down. I also have a fairly decent savings account. I'm terrified of being stuck paying loans for the rest of my life and wrecking my credit in the process.  


But I'm still so conflicted about the whole thing. I dont know what fields I could apply my work history towards, that would allow me to make more money without a degree. I think I'd really like something related to hospitality or travel but dont know if the opportunities would be there.. So I'm stuck with either potentially hitting a ceiling in a socioeconomic sense, or taking a gamble with my credit score and being stuck in loans forever. I just feel kinda trapped, like, I want more from my life but I dont know the way forward, or if the grass is greener on the other (degree) side..

I'm (18f) currently living with my Boyfriend (18m) at his Older sister(30 something)'s house. When we moved in last August, she said that for the first year we are living there our rent will only be $200 a month so we can save money to start our life out. Very nice of her, she didnt have to take us in. She wanted us to have at least $5000 saved, either split up between the two of us (we each save $2500) or save $5000 each. We had until August came around again.

For a little bit of context, before we moved in with her we had been living at my parent's for about 6 months. My boyfriend had been kicked out of his mom's house and my parent's graciously let him stay with us rent free so he could finish school. My parents are pretty much dirt poor, and as a result of that I had to/chose to drop out of school at 14 so i could work full time and help out with the bills. Life happens, and at the same time as my boyfriend moved in they found an 8cm cyst in my ovary. I left my job because my doctor told me it was at risk of twisting or something, and my mom got a D.I.Y. My poor dad was stuck supporting all of us, and I could see it was taking a toll on him, except he didnt complain. We got our gas cut off which meant no heat and no cooking because of our gas stove.

So my Boyfriend Graduates, Because of covid my surgery will take a year to happen, and we now live 4 hours away from my hometown with his older sister. She finds him a good job right away and I go against doctor's orders and get a job too after about 2 months of searching. I went from living on an acreage by a smalltown to the heart of the city, so I had a little bit of a tough time adjusting, but oh well.

The place I worked didnt treat me too well. I wouldnt have even noticed it until another coworker pointed it out. But oh well i just keep my head down and keep working. Because I was working and assumed I had until August to have money saved, I wanted to help my dad pay off the gas bill. We had left but he was still feeling the weight of when we had lived there, and I just wanted to help out/pay my debt to him. Especially since he didnt even have to help my boyfriend out like that. So I did that first, bought some winter clothes because canadian winters are harsh and just things like shampoo and conditioner, neccessities. 

I was honest and straightforward about my whole surgery situation from the start And when december came around, I booked a couple days off for holiday. Then my mom phoned me and said that my surgeon called and said that my Surgery will happen on December 22. I notified my work immedietely, because I had to leave back to my hometown for this and would be gone for awhile for recovery. Theres a closer city to my hometown, I'll call it Y. Y is an hour and a half from my hometown and thats where all my surgery was set to be. We moved to the city 'B' which is further away, but I could not move my surgery there because it would knock me down on the waiting list and who knows how long id be waiting in a larger city, plus the longer i'd wait to remove it the more dangerous it would be for me.

My surgery went smoothly, the only little issue was they couldnt schedule my follow-up appointment with my surgeon IMMEDIATELY after my surgery due to another waiting list, so I had to wait a month to figure out exactly what happened to me and if I could have kids. My doctors note said I needed 4-6 weeks off for recovery, But i healed up smoothly in 3 and returned to the City of 'B' intent to return to work. The whole time of my surgery+recovery I was at my parents house.

I called my manager, explained to him that I can probably return for light duty for the couple weeks before I have to book another week off to return to my hometown for my follow-up appointment (the reason its that long is because I dont drive and My dad booked too many days off work so we had to time it with his mandatory time off.) apologized for the inconcenience and told him that It should all be back to normal after this. He tried getting mad at me before catching himself, then hung up. I sent him the doctors note, and asked him to confirm if I was going to be scheduled. I saw he read it but he didnt reply. My work ghosted me and that was the last I heard from them, even after my follow up appointment
So I return to the city of 'B' after finding out the surgery went smoothly and I can have kids and all that. Because I hadnt worked in awhile I had to dip into what little I had saved to pay my rent and phone bill,  but I still made it on time. I start looking for a job.

Then my boyfriend's older sister pulls me and him aside and says that she feels like I'm taking advantage of her because im not working and my rent is so low and that I'm not saving as per our agreement, so if I dont find a job by March 1st my rent will be raised to $400. My boyfriend's will remain at $200 because she said he is his brother and all that. She was also slightly angry/annoyed that I didnt move all my surgery stuff to the city that I now live in, said that I hid ""quitting my job"" from her, (They ghosted me, I told her the whole story even before the convo. I used to complain to my Bf about my work treating me badly and maybe they overheard, maybe they thought I quit because of that?I kept half expecting to find a schedule in my email) and that I shouldnt have helped my dad pay off that gas bill because ""I'm an adult now and need to live my own life.""
I was annoyed but swallowed it and nodded, apologized for making her feel taken advantage of and accepted the deadline. I didnt want my reasons to come across as excuses, and I dont want to cause trouble. 
But I'm struggling so hard to find a job. I've applied everywhere, but nowheres hiring me. Even places like Macdonalds that are always hiring. my Boyfriend has payed this months rent for me and my phone bill, and wants to offer money to his sister to buy me more time... But I feel so bad, and he said I could have planned the whole thing better, and everyone seems mad at me. I think that his older sister thinks I'm a no-good mooching bum, but i'm only 18 and have 4 years of work experience and this is really the first time I've never had a job... i just dont know what to do.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,29022,public,self,"I'm not sure what to do, I feel like every action I take upsets somebody.",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t4ih8g/im_not_sure_what_to_do_i_feel_like_every_action_i/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,

I am from Naperville Illinois and am finishing up my 4-year degree. I am an Information Systems major with 4 internships of experience. All my friends are working full time (I am applying to jobs) and they seem to not have any free-time. Wake at 7am, drive to work by 8am, home at 5pm, dinner shower etc., free time starts at 7pm and asleep by 11pm. (These are obviously ranges but..) It stresses me out thinking about how I am going to manage doing my art while working.

You might say, instead, to pursue my art as a career instead. Without going to deep into it, it's just not feasible for me. I much enjoy it as a hobby, I'm certainly not good enough, yada yada. I just enjoy painting and think I will not have proper time to do so.

My process for oil painting is that I have to prep, usually base coat, layer, layer and stuff. Sometimes just a small painting can take 4-6 hours. I usually don't paint that long without breaks due to letting the paint dry however. So if my schedule was what I put above I would pretty much work for 8 hours and paint for about 2hrs everyday. This sucks ): as working in a tech firm is obviously not my passion but I'd be doing it for so many hours it would take priority over everything.

I perhaps thought working from home would be the answer. I could duck out every couple of hours and paint for 10 mins here and there.. But that seems dishonest and is WFH really here to stay?

I (think) a full-time salary (about $60k is what my friends in the same field are getting) is massive compared to what I would be making if I decided on working part-time. If I got a job working at a restaurant or something paying rent would be very difficult. Rent in my area is about $1,000 a month. Without a full-time salary I would have no savings, spending money, paint supplies ain't cheap etc. It seems the only option is to work full time, realize my time at college painting and doing music all day is going to be put behind me, and try to keep up with it on the weekends.

If you can't tell I'm a really lost college student who's about to enter the 'real world' and would appreciate any advice. Thank you

I (26) have not been doing great in school (Germany) the last four semesters, wherein the grades are of utmost significance, since they mostly determine your success when applying for studies at university. I was lazy as hell, skipped classes and have generally been a good-for-nothing. At least that's what I would love to chalk my miserable grades up to.

So, I did what no reasonable person would do: enrolled in humanities, did pretty much nothing for 7 years except for struggling with crippling
depression, sporadically playing in a rock band and day-drinking. 

Now I'm on a much better path. My ambitions and vigor made a shy comeback and now I'm confronted with the wish of studying medicine -- a 6 + 4 year long endeavor, that will need financing. This I don't worry as much about as the fact that I will have to finish a 3 year apprenticeship before to even have a slight chance to get accepted at university plus do extremely well in a test that will need months of intensive preparation.

Other than becoming a doctor I have no idea what to do with my life. I worked a lot of jobs since highschool -- no other profession is as rich in variety, demanding and exciting. But the doubts eat me alive. It will be really hard to get a spot at any university, and I will most likely have to move. What if it turns out that I really am simply not intelligent enough? What if it was all in vain?

Also, if I manage to do it, I will be at least 40 when I start at my first real position as a doctor.

What would you do if you were me? Which pieces of the puzzle are missing for you to be able to give me advice?

I've met up with my sister a few more times since that day, and nowadays she is super timid around me, which is totally the opposite of her usual energetic, outgoing self, spunky self. Whenever I'm in her presence, she sweats so much and it looks like she's trying her hardest not to cry. I remember one time where I accidentally dropped something, it wasn't too serious but as soon as she heard the loud thud she put her hands over her head and said to herself ""oh god please"". She always acts completely terrified when we're in the same room.

I've been debating on breaking/ending friendship/distancing myself for quite a while now, probably close to 3 years and I keep making excuses for why I should keep this person as a friend. 

Someone told me that as we get older, our life values change and relationships should be based on our values. 


Basically it comes down to these differences:
- Political views
- This person is INSANELY competitive, so much so they try to compare the stores we shop at and our romantic relationships (Wtf?)
- This person often times reaches out to me when they want something like to go to hang out if they have no one else to go with
- They don't respect my time or boundaries
- They are always trying to compare our appearances (who looks better etc)

I have not spoken to this person since last September. But I am thinking of messaging them soon, I've been prolonging it because I'm going through other stuff and want that to end before I reach out to this friend. 

This friend probably has no idea that I have been thinking of this because we've been friends for so many years. They will probably be caught off guard and they're probably wondering why I have not spoken to them in months. 

This friend has previously also gifted me a bunch of stuff (I never asked for these things) and I want to give it all back once I see them next time. 

If you were in this situation, what would you do? How would you feel if you were the friend? Would you rather know the details of why a friend has been distancing themselves?

I don't think I'm going to tell them exactly why I'm distancing myself but just going to say that I feel like my values have changed and that I can't be a good friend to them anymore. I don't want to discuss the little details like political views and all that. I was thinking of saying all this then giving back all the gifts and hopefully not contact them anymore. I wish them the best but just don't feel like we can be friends.

I just want to be happy after idealizing suicide heavily for these past 5 months. I just don't know what will make me happy...I've tried different things to no avail. I'm running out of time to make plans for the future and I'm stuck at a crossroads of staying or going. I mean, worse comes to worse, I unalive myself because of a deal I made almost 5 years ago that if I couldn't get my shit together by 30, then what's the point of it all? But that's fucking stupid. 

What will motivate me to do better if not anything but death? If money wasn't an issue, I don't think I'd be in the position I am today because I would have taken care of the problem by now. I'm so down on myself, I see no hope nor a chance for change because this is who I believe myself to be and I know that not to be true. I always believed that I want to do better if it meant that it made someone else happy, but this past relationship of 4 years proved that false and I need a different reason in order to do better because that's a learned behavior that I unlearned recently and now need to replaced with better teachings.

I don't want to go home because I fear of what may become if I stay there, but I also want to go home because that's where my friends are and I haven't been able to make many while here (because of the whole suicidal ideation, kinda kills the drive to make friends because who wants to be friends with someone who believes they don't want them there?). The people I have acquainted with are either flakey, criminals, too young or have no personality. Some people I've became acquainted with are really cool people, and we've exchanged numbers/socials, but I never ask to hang out because then it feels like an obligation on their behalf to have me around because they don't ask me to hang out specifically, even if they say ""come on through sometime"", I never will unless I get a specific invitation. I think something in my life something taught me to think and feel this way... It's just a lot for my brain to process and I don't have many outlets to confess to. It builds and builds and it causes even more illness....I really don't know what else my brain can take.

People work, study because they are pushed and don't have much choice to have food at the end of the day. However each one of my life goals doesn't go along with society, making things a little more complicated.

I also have a monthly allowance for being being disable, which is more than enough if you don't pay rent. The problem is these people pushing me to waste my time on things I don't want to do and that I can avoid doing. I admit I sometimes spend 90% of my free time using YouTube and reddit. 

Each day I improve little by little, whether it's discipline or quality of life, I'm tired of family pushing me to go university, this has some weight on my mind.

For the past 4 years I was employed as a production worker in a local manufacturer. There were aspects of the job which made me start fearing for my long-term health, so last month I left to go to a brand new manufacturer to my area, producing aluminum cans.

My heart wasn’t in it from the start, it was an overnight 7pm-7am job and I knew I was going to. I quit after my first week. I had $2,000 in my savings that I’ve been living on since (out of work for three weeks now). That money won’t last long because I have a brand new car, and rent an apartment with my fiancé.

Yesterday we were informed by our landlord that he is selling our house. We have 4 months left on the lease. I can’t help but feel my life is over. I’m 31 years old and I don’t even hold a job at the moment. 

Now for the elephant in the room, I’m an alcoholic. Been a daily drinker for 10 years. My later teen years were filled with depression, and once I turned legal age to drink, it changed everything and made it worse. 

I had a job interview at a pretty good company this morning, and I showed up still drunk from the night before. I think he noticed, but maybe that’s just my extreme social anxiety (I’m horrible at interviewing as I’m an introvert).

I’ve been lying at interviews telling them I’m still employed at my job of 4 years, because I don’t want them questioning why I only lasted a week at the newer job. I’m just so exhausted with my life and everything going on it’s hard to even type this to you.

I almost broke down at the gas station this morning in tears after my interview. I have no idea on what to do. Quitting drinking is number one, but unless you’ve experienced alcoholism it’s not something you can just ‘do’.

Returning to my previous job might be an option, should I try for that?

I was glad as it was highly toxic and I was really unhappy, I know it was the right decision and that I deserve better but I just want some advice on how to stop missing her and keep myself motivated during the healing process. 

I was first with my ex 6 years ago but we broke up after 5 months when I found out she was engaged, i gave her another chance last year which I now regret as I thought she would have changed. When we were together 6 years ago I found out she was engaged to someone else so that's why I broke it off and cut her off. 

She ended up getting divorced a year after her marriage, she did admit to having a few relationships afterwards. We got close and had some nice moments but I kept noticing how open she is with other guys and how she'd claim that every other guy was interested in her, she kept pushing me for marriage and kept blaming me for moving too slow just because I didn't want to rush in to marriage.  

Everytime we'd argue about it, she would always say that it's my fault that things are moving slow and that she doesn't like being with someone who can't commit. She always used to say that she wanted me to open up to her and tell her how I feel and that I can talk to her about anything if I'm ever upset. So I did when I mentioned that I didn't like how open she is with other guys, she said that she didn't want to be with anyone that's insecure just like her ex husband was (even though she'd already cheated on her ex husband with me which was unknown to me at the time, so he had a reason to feel insecure). 

I don't get why she'd tell me to talk to her about anything then end up throwing it back in my face! I told her I'm not happy so we agreed to end it, I was confused at first cos she used to tell me that she misses me everyday and after that conversation she ended up blocking me off everything at the startwhich I thought was childish. 

We had an argument a few weeks before the break up in which she said ""if we ever break up, it will be your loss"". At that moment in time, I actually felt worthless and believed her when she said it would be my loss because I thought I didnt deserve better but now I realise I do and that I rather stay single than to be involved with someone like her. I do miss her but I just want to heal and move on cos I know she's not good for me, and to help myself heal I am planning to stay away from relationships for a while and to do this I am planning on putting more focus on to my career (currently IT graduate, planning to advance my career by undertaking more software engineering certificates to enhance my career). I have also joined the gym now as another way to heal and improve mentally &amp; physically and to keep myself busy. 

We broke up 4 months ago but she messaged me on Christmas day saying: 'I just wanted to message you to say that I hope you’re okay and that I feel as though I’m ready to stay as friends with you if that’s what you wanted.. I didn’t think I would ever be able to say that we could stay as friends but I feel like I’m in a good place and I know everything has worked out for the best and I would be really happy to have you as a friend But if you don’t want to hear from me that’s okay too just let me know x' I did reply to her saying that I don't think it's a good idea and I wished her well. She just replied with a simple 'that's fine no worries x'. She hasn't messaged after that.

I'm trying to not think about her messaging me, but I feel like I was really getting in to the healing process and was really focused on other aspects of my life such as my career. I know I deserve better but I see her quite often as we live near one another and I can't help but still feel hurt and a part of me still misses her. I know I won't probably move on straight away but I don't know why I'm still hurting over someone that is so toxic for me.

I've recently finally managed to block her off every social media platform, I've accidentally deleted her number but if I end up finding it or if she messages me I will block that too.

I really like it here. I have close friends, a new boyfriend, and a part time job. My grad program recently extended my graduation date for “COVID” reasons, but allowed us to do school completely online if we’d like.  

With that option, I feel like maybe I should relocate a little closer to my parents. I’m a part of a very close knit immigrant family, where only my nuclear family is in the states. My sister moved far away for a job, and my parents have expressed to me how lonely they are and how they’d like me to move closer. Being the older sibling, I feel this obligation to be closer to take care of my parents. My dad is turning 60 this year, and has been talking about how he isn’t growing younger and would like to spend more time with his kids. 

My parents were very supportive of me moving away, and while they say they’ll be okay if I decide to stay here, they still want me to move back.
I enjoy my life here and I’m turning 25 this year. I have a new partner, and I’d like the opportunity to see if things would work long term with him, because I’d like to find a life partner soon, but I realize I can find a life partner anywhere. I can also find friends anywhere, but moving and starting my life over will definitely be difficult. I feel at home here, but I am always riddled with guilt knowing my parents are far away missing me. Should I move closer to home?

I also feel like if I were to make a move now, I’d want to move for a full time job, but since I’m in an accelerated graduate program, I wouldn’t want to handle a full time job with that program.

I am 2 months shy of 19 and I graduated in may. For the past month I have been completely stressed because of my family’s financial situation. For context, we have always been right on the brim of not needing assistance but not being able to afford certain things. Hence why I’m going to a community college so I can help pay for it too. I just recently got fired in December, I have a car that is out of commission, my commute is 30 minutes so I’ve been missing a lot of school and my grades are unrecoverable. I still have to pay for the classes though. My mom casually brought up the other day that she doesn’t know how her and my dad (after I put in my savings) will afford my semester. My boyfriend is in the same year of schooling as me and we are both planning on going for our bachelors. He’s also at community college. What’s been adding to this stress though, is that I have to take a gap year to work. I just started a new job today and have an income, but it’s not enough hours to cover my schooling if I’m still attending. My boyfriends family has never had problems with money and he inherited a great chunk that will be used for housing when he needs it and that money was just presented to him this week. He wants me to move in with him when we start going to school full time but I’m already stressing about the guilt I’ll have living off of their money. I also feel left behind taking a gap year as if I already didn’t feel that way going to a community college.

I wanna open by emphasizing that I don’t have it bad all things considered. When you birds-eye my situation, I’m a pretty lucky guy. I’ve got a nice house, cool parents that are still together, I’ve got friends, I’ve got a job, and I get to go to a really nice college without paying for tuition because of a relative of mine working there which also means I’m basically a shoo-in to get accepted according to said relative (who happens to teach what I want to major in). I don’t consider myself spoiled either, I’ve got a tangible sense of responsibility and I’m well aware of just how grateful I should be for all of this. I also have an idea of what field I'd like to major in, that being music as of now. And if that changes when I get there, I'd be fine with that too. I don't currently have any kind of romantic relationship and unfortunately haven't had one in a long time, but I'm not moping over it or anything.

So then what's even the problem? I'm not moping around about something and I have a lot of things going for me. Well, there it is. Right there. I have a lot going for me, in the future. I don't live in the future, I live right now. And right now, there's not a whole lot of anything going on. Everything I have to look forward to is tied to college. Like, e-ver-y-thing. And the worst part is that all the stuff I'm looking forward to is seemingly so tantalizingly close, but just out of reach either because of circumstances or my own inability.

I have music software, high quality software too (Ableton Live 11). I have it because of the backup install my older brother had when he started attending the same college and took a music class. I really shouldn't have any reason to not just spend all my time on that and just go nuts. Problem being that I didn't really grow up playing an instrument or being in that general band or orchestra crowd, so I'm just kind of teaching myself as I go along, and I suck at teaching myself. I've made one song and a lot of covers, and I like them all for the most part, I just want to do it more and I can't find anywhere to start. It's a miracle I even made an original song in the first place. I literally have no idea how to structure anything musically, I just go with what sounds good to me. I know the names of the notes and where they are on the piano and that's about it. You can imagine how frustrating coming up with any ideas is when that's all you have to work with. 

This isn't an impossible scenario though, I can learn to be more musically fluent, but again, college classes for that aren't in session until fall. I know there's other resources online for that kind of thing like YouTube and stuff, but I can't focus on a class when there's no stakes. If I'm watching some guy tell me something on a screen, it's gotta be either some really specific and precise tutorial of something, funny, or short. Music theory videos don't typically fall under that, plus I NEED the back-and-forth and the ability to ask questions. I'm not gonna comment on a video that's got a million comments and was uploaded 5 years ago and just sit there and wait for a response, I've been doing enough waiting already. The only other option is asking my relative, but the thing about college professors is that they're usually absolutely fucking swamped, so putting way more strain on that system is not what I want to do. So in this whole field, I really feel stuck.

But at least I have other things to devote my attention to, right? I'd mentioned how I hadn't been in a relationship in a long while, and getting into the dating game is something I'm not opposed to. I used to be really selfish when it came to girls (I was a freshman in high school, it's guaranteed to not go well), and I've had a lot of time to mature and I stand now with a much healthier perspective on what it means to be in a romantic relationship and the responsibilities I hold by being part of one. So I'm confident, I've had time to grow, I'm not shying away from the idea, but of course, there's a couple problems. First off, I still can't drive. I was supposed to get a license forever ago but covid really threw a wrench into my parents' system and here I am having not even practiced since, like, early December. Yeah, it's bad. 

I don't want to be a guy who asks someone out on a date and makes them drive. I don't know about anyone else but unless someone is physically unable to drive due to a missing body part or deformity of some sort then it feels the same to me as not paying for dinner. But say I didn't see it like that. I still wouldn't be able to reliably go to events to meet people without a car, so I'd be more or less restricted to the people that go to my school. I don't know about anyone else, but when you go to school with people for four years, it gives them a lot of time to find someone else they're already happy with. Everyone at my school is taken, and anyone that isn't is not my kind of crowd. But luckily, college comes in clutch once again, on both fronts. There's the obvious thing of just being able to be around a shit ton of new people, but the college I'm going to doesn't let freshmen drive or have a car on campus. I don't know if it's because they don't have space or because they don't trust them or both, but everything is within walking distance over there anyways so I don't care. I enjoy taking walks and biking already, now the playing field is getting leveled and there's no reason to be concerned about asking and then not driving because now everybody's not driving. Problem again being, college starts in the fall, and I've now made another thing I can look forward to that isn't happening soon enough for me to be excited instead of something I can devote time to now.

Well, now what? I guess I could do the thing every 18 year old does and just play a metric fuck ton of video games. Except that even before quarantine I was doing that way too much and now they've lost most of their appeal. Well what if I just took one video game and got really good at it? I've always thought fighting games were pretty cool, I've been playing smash bros for at least a decade now and I'm pretty good at that, but let's try something new, something fresh. I bought King of Fighters 15 yesterday, and I've been meaning to get decent or at least understand a more traditional fighting game. It looks fun and flashy and there's long combos, yeah, I'll definitely try it out. Alright, I think I'm kind of understanding how combo structure works somewhat, I've got a long way to go but I'm sure it's nothing some online matches against real people won't fix, I just need to have what I'm doing wrong pointed out to me.

And then it all falls apart. 142 ping. 243 ping. 542 ping. 746 ping. 990 ping. Doesn't matter what game, or what netcode. KoF 15, Street Fighter IV, Tekken 7, Rocket League, Halo Infinite, Titanfall 2, Doom Eternal Battlemode, Sonic Robo Blast 2 Kart, CTGP Mario Kart Wii, Mega Man 8-bit Deathmatch +CCBM Gondola 2.5 Beta, it does not matter. Even if I just went back to smash it wouldn't work. I've at least got friends that play smash, but playing against the same people every day since sophomore year tends to stop fostering growth after a while, and they absolutely refuse to give any other fighting game a chance, they will only play smash. The only other option is offline, single player stuff, and unless your name is doom eternal (which I've beaten already anyways) then I don't typically have too much interest. My parents have tried getting better internet, and right now they have they have the best setup they can reasonably get and it still sucks because our area is just kind of a dead zone. It shouldn't be, its in the suburbs, but it is. But here's another bright side. This college I'm going to is in an urban area, and according to my relative the internet is pretty great over there. It's gonna be really nice to not have to deal with crazy ping, or at least having to deal with it a lot less. Problem being, say it with me everybody, college starts in fall. Another way to pass time turned into something else to taunt me with.

So here I am. Some days I'm able to do certain things to get my mind off it, like biking or taking walks as I'd like to spend more time outside, but I can't get anything consistent. There's gonna be cold days and rainy days, and when those days come I don't have an answer. I've been trying to look on the bright side, I really have, I'd love to not be miserable and to just permanently look at all of this as something to look forward to right up to when I get there, but you look forward to something long enough and you'll lose it a little, I definitely have. I just have literally nothing else going on at all, and I don't know what to do about it. And as much as I know you're trying to help, please spare me the ""pick up a hobby"" response, because I don't know if you read the paragraph about my music career, but I have tried.

If you have any ideas I'm open to them, I really don't know what to do here, I just feel absolutely awful.

Well here I am, almost 2 years into my apprenticeship and almost a full Year in to working on clients. Despite trying to go into everything with an open mind and giving things a fair shot. I have never had a positive thought about Water Color tattoo's. In fact I have an even greater distaste for them now than I did before my apprenticeship. For that reason I would like to make a request to my Mentor I do not take on further projects in that style. However I do not know how to bring it up or how to word it. I have thought about wording it as simply as ""I have never had a positive thought about Water Color tattoos and would like to not take them on anymore."" and leaving the details of my personal thoughts out of it. Since she happens to really enjoy that style even though she rarely does it anymore, I want to avoid thought vomiting my distaste for that style. But I feel I should speak up at some point an request to no longer do it. I am just not sure exactly how to go about saying it or when to bring it up. I will for obvious reasons not bring it up in front of clients. I was thinking about waiting till she expresses her distaste for certain styles (as she has gone on some very long rants about another particular style). However I don't know if I can wait that long since I think these next 2 water color pieces I am doing makes it much more pieces than I ever wanted to do. So I would hate to wait another year or so till I am booking up to say I cant stand a style.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I am a Tattoo Apprentice who's mentor say's I should try every style and not narrow down my clients I take on till I am booking.

23M Grew up in MA and went to a ""special"" school. Had a Single mom who was emotionally unavailable, dad who saw me every other weekend until i was 12.  

Now,

Story time:

Just this past Wednesday, I was fired from my job (Biotech manufacturing at a very small company, &gt;50 employees). I had only been working there for a couple of months. I was a contractor so they didn't need to give a reason why either, but I can probably guess.

My work ethic is shit, honestly. I have problems with authority, I have problems staying focused, I have problems learning with minimal support, and I am chronically late. I take too many breaks and goof off on the computer or my phone very frequently. I know this all sounds really bad but honest to god, i can't find it in me to genuinely give a shit about my job. I feel like everything I do at work is utterly meaningless and it's never fulfilling for me so why bother putting in the extra effort? I'm certain that this attitude is what led to me losing this job, but I can't seem to get myself out of the headspace that work is bullshit and a waste of my precious and finite time on this earth.

I know now that I need to get a new job. I cant move back in with my mom cause shes living in a section 8 studio apartment. I feel like college is off the table since i dont have the money or time for it. I also don't want to get another job just to quit or get fired after another few months because i cant keep up the facade that i give a shit. No job out there seems fulfilling. Except maybe a substitute teacher or aid, but those jobs pay absolute garbage. and i just might get sick of those too. 

Im so lost in life and I know I need to find my way sooner or later. I'm doing my best to stay positive, I dont want to just sit around and feel sorry for myself. I want to work hard towards my dreams and do something meaningful and fulfilling in my life but I just have no idea where to begin.

Basically, my mom and dad are dating and my mom is going to move in with my dad in missouri (we live in Virginia). I wont be joining her because Im in college, I don't want to move out because then the price might go up given that id then be an out of state student. In other news, I might not have anywhere to live this summer while I wait for school to start again. I think I do have the options of living with my friend or my grandma. Me and my mom have been living with my grandma since I can remember. The reason Im unsure that this is an option is because, also since i can remember my grandma has said that when my mom moves out she was going to get her own house. So she might move out right when my mom does. Along with this, she has caused me a lot of stress and she just isn't a fun person to be around for extended periods of time. So, I dont really enjoy the idea of living with her. On the other hand I could stay at my friend's house. This is a longtime friend of 14+ years. We are basically sisters so it wouldn't be weird for me to live in the same house as her and her family. However, her girlfriend did just move in with them aswell so I feel like it may just be a lot of extra people, even  though they do have an extra guest room I would probably stay in. Along with this though, they have a dog and a cat and Im not sure but I think i might be allergic to one of them if not both. Everytime I spend the night there, my throat feels scratchy in the morning. It could also be the degertent they use. Sorry, that's not the point. They also rarely have any food that I like there, which isn't a problem when I'm there for a week or so. Im fine with living off ritz crackers and popcorn every now and then. But I dont think I can do that for like 2 months. Another option I just thought of, would be to live in my car but go spend the night at the two's homes along with other family memeber's homes when I need to.

I’ve been getting better, slowly but definitely walking a better path. I at least have made somewhat of a plan for myself. I’ve always struggled with dating, but recently I’ve been seeing girls and testing the waters. I’ve been hanging out with this one girl who goes to university about 30 min away from me. It’s been a decent couple first dates, I mean I’m not sure she’s a long term partner but I haven’t dated in a long time so I figured what the hell let’s just see where this goes. She’s not from the area so we decided I should show her around. We ended up going to the nearest big city and showing her all the different parts of town I grew up going to. We had drinks at some bar and actually had pretty good time. That was until it was time to go. She doesn’t drive so it was up to me to get her home. I was obviously a little drunk so we decided to wait around for a bit. We considered getting her an Uber but considering it was an hour drive back and 2 AM, it cost $60.

I should’ve just paid them. If I could go back now I would in a heartbeat. I decided after about an hour that I was sober enough to drive. Biggest mistake I’ve made in a while. I feel so guilty, everything was fine until about 40 min into the drive I started feeling drowsy. I ended up swerving off the freeway and hitting the guard rail off to the side. Luckily everyone is okay but My friend was terrified and I’m solely responsible for it all. I feel sick, so fucking irresponsible and stupid. I feel so guilty for not only endangering my life but hers and others on the road. 

I apologized with all my remorse and I promised myself I’ll never do anything like that again but I still feel guilty and so ashamed. I just want to be forgiven this isn’t really me. I’m not an idiot who drives drunk, I just really thought I can get her home safe and not look like a loser sleeping in his car.

Ever  since this summer, when I was living in a campus dorm, my  groin/prostate has been on the fritz. It thumps up ad down. Recently, I  have had the sensation in my legs that feels like someone is having sex  with me. I have gone to multiple doctors and urologists, and they have  all been unable to diagnose me with anything. I thought it was a  prostate infection, or possibly pelvic inflammation, but it went away  for a while and came back.

Here's  the chilling part. I had a traumatic brain injury when I was 19, and  when I went back to the dorms, I began to feel psychosis surrounding the  people living around me. When I was living in the dorms this summer, I  was in a bad place and was talking to myself, thinking I was talking to  someone else. I bragged about parts of my life that I should not have  (my penis size, my IQ, my lack of student loans), and it was after  living in this situation for a few weeks that the problem with my groin  started to occur. When it got really bad over the summer, I remember  being so fed up that I told my neighbors if they did not stop I would go  to the police, and the voices in my head got scared and said that they  were a couple of exchange students who using an implant technology. That  is when the idea of the implant started. Over the course of the past  semester, the voices in my head got so bad that I told my mom that I  though I had been implanted, and was subsequently admitted to a mental  health institution, where I was put on anti-psychotics. The problem with  my groin stopped. The voices that I was hearing attenuated. I was able  to recover and start a new semester of my doctoral program without any  hitches.

Over the past few days,  the problem with my groin, the feeling that someone is trying to have  sex with me (it's in the way the blood moves in my legs, or at least the  sensation), and the voices are back. They still want me to go to New  Hampshire to be their slave. I understand how this sounds like a  psychotic delusion, and that you may think I have schizophrenia, but I  have never been diagnosed with schizophrenia and have no positive  symptoms. The only thing that doctors have told me is that I have  psychosis following a traumatic brain injury, but that does not explain  the feeling between my legs.

I  have scoured the internet, and have never been able to find information  about a similar condition involving someones genitals and the  surrounding tissue, leaving out any of the voices that I hear in my  head. The problem is that sometimes, it feels good. Like really really  good. I cannot seem to find any medical condition that mimics the  symptoms that I am feeling. I have never ejaculated to the feeling  alone, but I have come close, which I cannot explain.

I  have been doing some research, and I have discovered V2K brain  communication, and the idea of neural dust. In a harassment techniques  article that I was able to find, and will attach a link to, I have found  harassment techniques that sound strikingly similar to what it seems  like I have been experiencing. Ever day, I get called schizophrenic, a  f\*ggot, and a retard by my own brain for reasons I cannot explain. I am  told things about my peers that I believe but turn out not to be true,  which i find out later. They have at times kept me up all night for  multiple days in a row. Again, I know that this sounds like  schizophrenia, but keep in mind that I am a high functioning student in  my last year of a doctoral degree in pharmacy. I get good grades and  keep my room clean, and I care about my personal hygiene. I do not  demonstrate the symptoms of schizophrenia, even when I have undergone  multiple psychiatric evaluations to try and understand what my problems  are.

Keep in mind that gaslighting  is one of the harassment techniques on the list, so while I know this  may sound crazy, I ask you to consider it may have been feasible. Is it  possible that someone implanted my with multiple neural dust implants,  which would give them control over my muscles (my prostate/groin), as  well as allow them to read and interpret my thoughts. I have even heard  the voices say that we can see through your eyes, followed by a  description of what I am wearing/what I am doing. I may be in danger  just for writing all of this out.

This  has been going on for a while, and I am finally starting to catch on to  the fact that this cannot be organic. I am still taking antipsychotics  and Alfusozin, which is supposed to release the tension in my groin, but  it seems like every day someone is messing with my, making me feel like  someone wants to have sex with me. The size of my flaccid penis has  also grown noticeably in the past few days, so that people can see a  visual bulge.

Is it possible that I  have been implanted by neural dust by someone I may have inadvertently  pissed off by talking shit to them, when I thought I was talking to  myself? Is there any way to find out, to take a scan or something to see  if it is there, there is not a lot of evidence on the internet. This  isn't even a legal advice question, I just didn't know where else to  post it. I know that this seems like a highly improbable situation, but I  know that what I hear and feel is real, even when nobody else does.  While I did have psychosis following my traumatic brain injury, it was  nowhere near as intense as this can get sometimes, as if multiple people  are screaming into my ears.

I am  calm in the moment, but I know I need help to get rid of this. I am  already on anti psychotics. I am already doing speech therapy, although I  fear telling my therapist because I worry that he too will think I am  not in my right mind. I do not know what else this could be, other than  some sort of mind control/manipulation device designed to drive me  crazy, or to get me to go to New Hampshire, where the people who I hear  in my head ask me to go to continuously. Once I found out about Neural  Dust, I could not help but feel like I was in the exact situations that  the harassment techniques describe.

Please  let me know if you have any idea how to sense for or take these things  out, tips on ways to block the signal, or ways to try and destroy their  signaling capabilities (MRI?).

I did this due to the fear of “wasting time” acting like a kid, and the fear of struggling as an adult. Thus, I was regarded as the “smart” or “good” kid, since I stayed out of trouble and did well in school. I was also very anxious around people, was ostracized for being socially awkward, never stood up for myself, had poor self-confidence, and often daydreamed to escape reality. My teenage years weren’t better, and could be summed up as: judging people based on their academics, skipping out on meeting people at school clubs and parties in favor of studying, daydreaming in classes and before sleep due to sheer boredom, and trying too hard to please my parents. 

In reality, I was living off imaginary lies that my brain fabricated. As I mentioned, I’d turn down going to social events in favor of studying for 10 hours in my room just so everyone would think I was hardworking, and that I wouldn’t fear the retribution or disappointment of “failing” that midterm or assignment. In reality that didn’t work, mainly because I didn’t have efficient study methods, but also because in my mind, I set the bar too high and mostly imagined the results without putting in the work. Seeing that I didn’t get good marks led to me comparing myself to other peers made me frustrated at others’ achievements, but also at myself. I constantly beat myself up saying why I couldn’t do this, or what I do to deserve this. My academic performance tanked as a result, and that resulted in tension between my peers and even strained relationships. Essentially, I made myself a victim when in reality, it was my mentality that was driving this behavior. I eventually got called out on this behavior, and from then on, I made sure to not compare myself to others and instead focus on myself. It paid off as I did better in the next few semesters, strengthened the relationships between my peers, and in general, felt a sense of peace knowing that as long as I was doing well for my standards that it was perfectly okay. 

Currently, I have six weeks left before I am done with undergraduate studies. Throughout university, I’ve always wanted to go into research and thus grad school, but now I think it was due to maladaptive daydreaming, specifically about the thought of the results: being successful and intelligent. In fact, I never really paid attention to the steps needed to get to the results. Thus, I don’t have much experience when it comes to working in research, and now it’s really starting to show. I’m too lazy to contact supervisors, brush up my resume, look at career prospects, or most importantly, even do research in the graduate schools I want to go into. I have to admit, I even feel empty at times when I even think about what I want to do after graduation. Ultimately, I realized that I don’t have a solid purpose in mind about why I want to pursue graduate studies. In fact, the main reasons are due to making my parents proud, and also because it is the other option other than medical school since job prospects are limited with a BSc. Part of me wants to take a gap year after I graduate, but I fear that I’d be wasting time and won’t be motivated to do anything afterwards. And that relates back to my fear of being left behind in the dust and moving along slowly in life, thinking that if I don’t do everything now, that I won’t have much time left to accomplish the things I really want to do later. I'm trying to get rid of this mentality that has been instilled in me since I was young, but to be honest, it's easier said than done. 

This fear has also affected me socially; I deleted Instagram as I thought it was a waste of time but in reality, it was so I didn't need to see the constant posts of people highlighting the best moments of their lives. While I thought that would help me as I could then focus on improving my own life by actually going out to socialize and therefore overcome my social anxiety, it didn't really do much. In fact, I feel anxious and passive towards people, just like I did in the past. While I could say the pandemic could have been a cause of this, I would be lying to myself if I made that my excuse, since I'm working a part-time job that requires me to talk to people frequently. Even then, there are times where it takes a lot of courage to ask someone for something and I end up just shying away from it, especially with people I normally don't interact with frequently. Worst case is whenever someone yells at me and I freeze up in fear and eventually need someone to come bail me out. Then I keep daydreaming about how I could have stood up to them and become stronger as a result, and keep thinking why I didn't do that before. Sometimes these thoughts keep ruminating in my mind, and can be very intense at times. 

If you ended up reading the wall of text, thank you, I really appreciate it.

Although we live in England, the rest of our family live in primarily in Kiev and Moscow. 

Ever since I was a little kid, I have felt conflicted over my identity. I was raised in the UK, with an accent and a name clearly not from there, so my surroundings didn't help much. I got relentlessly bullied over my mannerisms, traditions, foreign name, everything. It doesn't help that I'm autistic, trans, and physically weak.

School is a nightmare for me. I get stomach aches and migraines from anxiety when the going gets tough, and I've been to the doctor's multiple times for a related heart condition. Not a day goes by where I don't consider killing myself.

My family is a proud one, with the majority of the men being in the army and the women mostly being successful business owners on both sides. I was always taught to value my heritage/background and it was a point of confidence for me that my grandparents where war veterans. My peers weren't very appreciative of this, and just called me and my family warmongers and murderous drunks.

I have vehemently defended myself despite this, as well as my heritage in the past, to my detriment as of recent times. I go back to school tomorrow,  but I have already had people talk to me and say racist things about me over text when they don't even know the full story.

 I don't know how I can keep going anymore. My family has caused me nothing but grief and now there's a war that will end in god knows what tragedy. I see no other way out other than to kill myself.

I am almost 34 years old and feel like I have hit rock bottom in all aspects of my life. It's as if I woke up and realized that I have wasted almost 34 years of my life and I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I don't know how to fix things. The life I have dreamed of having seems so far away that it feels impossible I'll ever get there. When I think of my life over the past 5 years it feels like it's been one long cycle of disappointment after disappointment. I have become cynical and my disappointment in people has left me with little hope for great relationships and friendships in the future. 

I live in a city I hate, but I feel stuck here because of my mom. She was a single mom and sacrificed a lot for me growing up and it's always just been her and I. She tries to talk me out of moving away, saying things like she will have no one if I leave and generally making me feel guilty. I have wanted to move for over a decade but feel scared to make that leap because I am also emotionally dependent on her in many ways. 

I don't feel fulfilled in my career. I'm in tech and I make good money, but I feel dead on the inside and couldn't care less about what I do. The truth is, I never have but it's hitting me harder the older I get and the more death I encounter. I realize I could die in 10 years and I will have spent my life in a career that I find no meaning in. But I'm afraid to leave because I have gotten used to living on the salary I have now and I don't know what else I could do. 

The catalyst of me feeling like I have hit rock bottom has been the demise of all of my female friendships over the past year. I place a lot stock of my worth in friendships, and truthfully they are something I have always struggled with my entire life. I was never the cool kid in school and I was painfully shy and awkward. I spent my summers in HS wishing I had friends to hang out with. Later on in my adult years I was able to develop friendships but it seems I can't keep them. Or maybe I pick the wrong friends but since I'm the common denominator it seems I am doing something wrong. I have had a falling out with over 10 friends over the last decade. Specifically, I have lost 4 female friendships this past year. One friend who I trusted stabbed me in the back and caused the loss of another friendship. Another friend had jealous tendencies and was competitive for men. Another friend and I had an argument over a seemingly small issue but our friendship completely shifted after that. She made no real effort to fix things and when I called her out on it, she became defensive and it led to more arguing. 

From a romantic relationship standpoint: My last serious relationship ended 5 years ago and I haven't been with anyone since then. Marriage and kids seem so far away that they feel impossible at this rate. It's hard watching everyone around me get engaged, married, and having kids while I'm still in the same spot I was in 5 years ago. 

I feel immense disappointment in the life choices I have made because they led me to where I am now. At the same time, I don't know how to fix things or where to start. I realize this is a complex and loaded post but I wanted to see if anyone else has ever experienced feeling similarly and how they managed to turn their life around in their 30s.

Though I didn’t see it coming, I understand why she did and don’t blame her for her choice (I work in a very stressful and demanding field which took up a lot of my time and I was often absent; even when I was there, I was there I was often irritable with both her and the children, I was not a good husband). We were together about 13 years and whilst there were times we argued, I thought we were mostly happy. I later learned that she wasn’t, and feel terrible that I was not aware of this.

For a long time I hoped that we might be able to fix things, and while she says she doesn’t want to get divorced, I have come to the intellectual realisation that she is never going to have any feeling except friendship at best, or patient tolerance at worst. Whilst I have acted badly in the past (I found out about a new sexual partner a few days/weeks after our breakup by looking at her text messages) I am professionally involved in the after effects of domestic abuse and have tried to avoid acting in anyway that would make her uncomfortable or distressed. We have remained fairly close for the sake of the children.

I know that she has seen other people. I thought this would make it easier to get over the end of the relationship. It hasn’t. I also knew it was inevitable: she is a beautiful and accomplished woman. I am jealous, but also want her to be happy, and would be content enough if she was. She deserves it. 

But, from almost the moment I met her, I knew she was the love of my life, and I still feel that way.  I’m not interested in seeing anyone else, and even if I was, don’t feel it would be fair to another potential partner to enter into anything while I still have feelings for her. 

To complicate things, she is currently being treated for a serious cancer, and whilst there is a good chance of entering a period of remission, I have (at her request) been involved in her care and support.

I desperately want to move on.

I am having a real problem with my step mother. 

Background my mom died a decade ago and my father remarried. it is also important to know that she is almost as old as me and is a gold digger. Before my father remarried my father already gave me the inheritance of the ancestral land as well as the family business. Currently, my father still manages the family business and my step mother handles the finances and permits of the family business. As for me I am working on a business similar to our family business but has is bigger so I could get experience from bigger businesses or companies so by the time I handle the family business I would have enough experience to manage the business as well as be ready for business expansion/growth and what possible obstacles I may face when I am managing the family business. Also my step mother has a notorized letter or contract whatever it is that on the event my father died she no longer has any right to live in the ancestral house and would also mean the family business.

Currently I am minding my own business whenever I am home at the ancestral house (I am mostly away from home due to my work being on a different province). And this step mother of mine is being really bossy and a dick to me while still being a ""nice person"" to everyone outside the family.

Examples on her being a dick and bossy:
&gt; (I am not allowed to have my own room and should share with my siblings) while her son should have its own bedroom. 
&gt; I am making a ""gaming shed"" as a side project in the vacant lots which I also own. But she let her friends stay there and use it as a guest room for about a month and this friends of hers have no love for my things and furnitures in there and when I confronted her about this she tells me that why don't I just buy a new lot and make my own gaming shed there
&gt;My father and I have a joint bank account where we maintain an amount that can be covered by the bank in case of closure whenever there is a growth due to interest the step mother transfer that to her account.
&gt;I am not allowed to have my own pet at home because she does not like pets and often tells me that I should just buy a new home and have my pet there even though I legally own the ancestral home.
&gt;She one time got angry with me due to pet stuff (I bought one without her consent even though my father already give the ok sign and in her rage she destroyed the printer which I bought with my own money and tells me it is my fault 

I am an introverted person so I just run away from most confrontation. But whenever we do I always gets filled with rage to maybe hurt her and sometimes kill her but I just brush it off and just go to my room and sleep it off. The only reason I could see for not murdering her is my father would be sad. Now I feel like my rage and other feelings are being pent up and I might release it once I get pretty full.

Honestly I don't know what to do. I tried telling this to my father but tells me I am just being too sensitive and stuff.  

And for now I don't know if I should just keep the feelings to myself, beat the shit out of her, find a way to sue her or stuff. Sometimes I think going to jail for battery and assault or murder would have been acceptable for me whenever I feel rage. Can you give me advice on how I could solve this issue of mine?

Literally the day I finished college was the same week the pandemic hit our state way back in 2020. Since then I've just been laying low, kept my job as a caregiver while being given more roles within my workplace that goes more into what i studied (communications, media) until last July where I was working so much I hit a wall and had to quit everything due to burnout. This whole time I wasn't making any content, couldn't work my normal video gigs, and was overall just too depressed and tired to do anything in my free time. During that time I also lost track of my hard drive, which had all my work up to that point on it. 

So. I'm feeling better now, I've gotten myself a part time service job while I look for something more in line with what I studied. Ultimately I would like to work in video, but marketing/social media work is good too. I've been applying for nearly three months and have only gotten one interview that I felt good about, but they turned me down. I've found some odds and ends of samples I can give, but nothing seems to be enough for employers. Even positions that are ""entry level"" require like three years of some specific task experience. The pay grade is a whole other thing. I'm also trying to move to a nearby city, and I can't really do that until I secure something solid.

When I was 18th on my birthday, I had a birthday blue (2nd worse birthday, I had) because I remember when I left High school and move to college, I was very depressed myself because I'm scared of changes.

On my 20th birthday it was the worst birthday, I ever had, I even told my family ""don't say happy birthday to me, I even switch notification off from Facebook so that no one knows it was my birthday and I hadn't told my school it was my birthday. The main reason I had the worst birthday is because I was extremely scared to be an adult. From 20th birthday onwards, this is when I don't like birthday anymore because I am too scared.

I am only scared of being an adult is because I will be terrified if I leave my parents away, I might leave my hobbies which are watching anime shows and if I am alone being independent on my own and then if a random stranger shout at me face to face I will be very sad. So if I have kids and if someone hurt my children I am unable to stand up for myself because I can't shout, I'm not strict person.

But my parents aren't planning for me to move to another house alone, however, if a random stranger or a person that I know ask me are you planning to move to your own flat. I will be heart broken it feels like it's an offensive to me when someone says that.

I hate it. This one is going to be a long one i feel. Theres a lot to cover. Last year on new years day, my father passed after a very long illness. I took it hard even though i knew it was coming. My friend didnt even mention it to me until a month after it happened. And then it was just a, ""yeah. Im sorry"" while i brought it up. My best friend is a lesbian and got married last summer. Im supportive of her relationship. Over the years, ive done everything for this girl. A place to live. Someone to pay her bills when she needed help. A shoulder to cry on. Gifts. And just in general being a good friend. I had her back like a buttcrack. Anyways lets fast forward to last summer where she introduced me to a new friend of hers who i hit it off with right away. We dated for about 6 months. Then it ended pretty badly. I was a great boyfriend. Watched her out of control boys and provided for them, cleaned the house, paid the bills, put up with the drinking, put up with a highly toxic person she keeps in her life, and great sex (body dont lie). But she cheated on me and i found out she was still married. I took that pretty hard because i put more than i usually do in that relationship. (This is why i dont do that kind of thing). So i had to move out because i was NOT going to tolerate that. I couldnt pack all my stuff so i told her id be back for it later. Welp, she stole my tv, my bed, some clothes, my xbox series s, games, and some other things. Shes since moved a few towns away in with the guy she cheated on me with. Ive tried sending cops but they werent able to get ahold of her (go figure). So i talk to my best friend over all this and SHES STILL FRIENDS WITH HER! So i ask for help in getting my things back and for me to talk to my ex because i want to know what the hell i did to deserve being treated this way. She said shed try. Fast forward a few months, she hasnt tried, and shes still friends with her. I mean, im your best friend. Cant you be mad for me even a little. So she asked me to watch her kids for a week while her and her wife took a vacation. I said fine. I also did other things for them i will not get into because it is controversial subject matter and has no bearing on this topic other than to say i did something for them that i didnt really want to but literally no one else would (best friend, you know). Now we come up upon the anniversary of my dads death. I was going over and over in my mind how one sided this friendship had become. So i started talking about hanging out on new years and christmas since i now live alone. They said sure and even tried to include me in with her wifes family but all of a sudden i couldnt go. I figured that was fine. Its more of a family function anyways. But then new years. Kids were being babysat by grandma. No other plans. So i watched the kids 3 days prior to new years so they could get a few days to themselves and when they got back, the morning of December 31st and basically said, go home we dont need you to watch the kids anymore, i blew up and yelled. I apologized immediately afterwards because i said some pretty nasty things (i personally think that GoT adage is true, ""Words are wind"" and that our actions are what really matter) and left. We didnt speak for two months. Then recently, she dm'd me asking to talk. I said it had to be in person because i feel extremely disrespected in this friendship and if she had any decency shed speak to me face to face. We did. Lo and behold she came to me to reconcile (still never apologized) only because she needed someone to talk to about her wife flirting with and openly admitting to flirting with another girl at work. So i confronted her wife and said its messed up and i consider it cheating especially if youre married. But its not unsavable. Because i dont like fighting. I want everyone to be happy. Then they blocked me because i brought up the fact okay, i helped you. We still havent addressed how youve treated me. So this was a few days ago. I messaged her sis last night whom i found out doesnt really talk to her and found out my best friend is so selfish that her 10 year old neice was raped and hasnt said a word to her sister, even after her sister tried to message her. Apparently, shes always been this self serving. I realize that in telling a story there is always two sudes. But this is literally everything that happened from my side. And when i tried to continue to speak with her she suddenly got really busy, like she couldnt face it. My current girlfriend says i need to just stop trying to do stuff for people who dont appreciate it and dont respect me. Im really thinking of taking that advice. Its just hard because i dont understand it. Its in my nature to be caring and helpful. Was it because of that or was i just too dumb to notice of someone taking advantage of my kindness for years? Dont get me wrong, theres some good memories and she has some good qualities, but should i have to go against my own values in some areas and willingly take the selfish dusrespect i get. Im loyal to a fault, i guess. I just dont know what to do. Should i keep trying to help her understand because what if shes not being willfully ignorant? What if she really doesnt understand?

**The only time I've been in love, it wasn't mutual.** 

She didn't say that, though, she just took advantage of the effort I gave her without expecting anything back.

I found out she was pregnant, to a married man's baby. I wanted to be there for her, and support her... but I decided to show some self-respect, and not do that unless I knew she would appreciate it.

It was obvious that she wouldn't, so I was alone... and I've remained alone for three years.

I thought I would find someone else, and I would get over her without having to quit. I had to keep my job because I was studying, and I couldn't work full-time.

So I saw her multiple times a week, for her entire pregnancy.

I picked my sister and my niece up at the hospital, and had to go back to the ward at one point... 

I was honoured to be involved in my niece's life at such an early age, but it was sad, because I know this is what my ""ex"" went through as well.

She was in hospital, and had a baby. 

My niece had to see some nurses at home. My ""ex"" would have been speaking to nurses about how her son was doing, and weighing him, and doing blood tests and stuff. 

I would have loved to support her, and share in her journey as a friend, but I couldn't. She didn't want me to.

The other night I saw her and her new boyfriend together for the first time. They were looking deep into each other's eyes.

I really wish I had my stuff together and knew what I have wanted so I can work for it little by little. I feel like I'm trapped inside my head and don't or will ever see a way out. Since i was a kid i never payed attention in school. i always just daydreamed of random stuff and never did my homework or cared. i just liked watching tv, playing video games and hanging out with friends. it didn't help that i was very shy and quiet with strangers and classmates so  i never wanted to do anything outside my comfort level. I always felt self conscious about my looks and what people thought about me making my years a waste as i didn't want to try anything new. i wish i could have played piano or guitar or focused on my writing and drawing as that is something i loved doing. now I'm in university and i am taking too long and still cant focus on my school work or organizing my duties and time management. on top of that i am 30,000 in debt. have a full time job and a second early morning job making it harder to do school work and hobbies. living in the bay are makes it even harder when everything is much mire expensive. i just feel as though there isn't a job for me out here that i will like doing  I really feel like I'll end up disappointing me and my family.

I am 24 and single, no kids/pets. I still live with my parents, my parents are moving to a tiny home so I will have to find my own place anyways. I have been making 15 an hour the past few years but am not unemployed (though in 3 months I could go back to work for the same contract company I did work for). I have been saving about 1/3-1/2 my pay check the past few years and have just over 30K saved.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently live in charleston SC but I recently intervied with microsft and have recieved an offer for a data center technician postion out in pheonix arizona

&amp;#x200B;

The offer is 23.65 base pay, with full benefits, stock options and 3 weeks PTO. additionaly i would be recieving an 8K relocation bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of job satisifaction. I think I would be happy as working in a data center is something I truely do enjoy (most of my job expierence is working in a data center, prior to that I worked f&amp;b which was okay but not for me).

&amp;#x200B;

I am nervous about moving across the country to a place where I wouldn't know anyone or anything really. But yet at the same time I am very excited about the job itself as I think it would be a great way to truely start a career.

I have no big or small dreams or goals, and I feel okay with my life ending now. I wish assisted suicide was an easy process… I used to be happy, careless and active.

Me and my best friend have a very close emotional relationship and always have done we tell each other everything. We both suffer from quite severe anxiety and we always have supported each other. We fell out yesterday largely to my fault. To clarify we are both straight but there has been and never will be Any romantic connection and I do not want that we have always been best freinds. She was in what seemed to be quite a toxic relationship with a guy we will call Steve, Steve and me have always been close my best freind always went to me for advice on steve, Steve never knew I felt disloyal to him but I did it with his interest in mind to save his relationship. On Friday Steve dumped my best friend they still want to be freinds I met them on the day they split it was very awkward there was a lot of tension between them which is understandable they were together for 18 months. Since they split up until yesterday me and my best freind were speaking lots and meeting we never went more than 3 hours without texting my best freind would often text me firstly she trusted me with everything. On Tuesday night I was struggling with anxiety this was because my brain had convinced me that my best freind didn't like me even though we were so close I couldn't speak to her as she was asleep. So I spoke to Bruce who is good freinds with me and my best freind and Steve. I was confused I thought Bruce and My best freind met up on Tuesday night but they hadn't. I asked Bruce if I was mentioned which I shouldn't of done but I was very anxious Bruce explained my best freind wasn't actually there and decided to screen shot his chat with my best friend to prove it. This is what caused issues I did not want him to do that as It was on snapchat so my best freind knew. I never asked Bruce to screen shot. My best freind asked Bruce why he screen shot and he said he had to prove to me. Which was a bit untrue. So my best freind started questioning me on Wednesday morning saying I was stalking her and I'm obsessed which is very false. This is where I messed up bad. So I explained to my best freind what happened but she was upset I'd think she'd dislike me and talk about me and said it made her look bad which I agreed with I apologised. But I got defensive and was slightly rude she said she didn't want me stalking I said "" I don't give a fuck what you do"" I was very wrong to do that and I hate myself for saying that I've never spoken to her that way. We argued a bit but then I started apologising a lot I didn't want to lose her I knew I was wrong. She said I lost her trust and she won't tell me things anymore. She then told me to have a good day and we stopped speaking. We didn't speak for around 12 hours I then text apologising and asking how I can fix it and that I missed how things were before and I hated myself for how I spoke to her I wasn't stalking what I did was wrong but I wasn't stalking and I was very anxious at the time and that I wanted to talk about things and I'll be more mature when we talk about it. She said ""we don't need to talk about it"" we then spoke about other stuff but it was very off she was very blunt. We then spoke this morning I asked how she was i was expecting her to be anxious as Steven who has been on holiday abroad comes back to town tomorrow. But she said she was fine I hope she is fine but I have a feeling she's not. I then spoke about yesterday's events and explained everything and apologised and all I wanted was for it to go back to how we used to be. I said If she wants space or wants to discuss it that's fine I just wanted to fix it. But she told me not to mention it We then spoke about other stuff I was talking about my mums birthday. After talking for a bit she said she was busy and had to go she did wish me a good day so that's a positive but she was very off with me the whole time the replies were very dry.Since then 5 hours ago we haven't spoken but she has spoken to other people which is not an issue. But she normally always wants to speak to me so it's weird she hasn't. I'm not messaging her atm I want to give her space. The last 2 times we spoke I initiated contact. I haven't slept or eaten since it happened I want my best friend back the guilt of how I spoke to her is really hurting me I never get angry at her I wasn't angry I was scared.

I work, have always had a job since I was 16, but I dont have a degree, or a stable career.
I've gone to college 3 different times, first time was right out of high school, and I didn't want to go, flunked and dropped out my first semester.
The second time was when I was 22. I was going for nursing, and finished all my gen Ed's to get into the program, and also got accepted. I did fairly well this time around and raised my GPA to a 4.0. 
Well before the start of the program, I decided I didnt want to go into nursing because I've always had mixed feelings about it. So I took another break. Last February, I thought, why not. I got accepted into the program before, I'll try again. Mind you, I didnt really explore any other options. I got aid, took out some loans, forked out money for certain things (UA, background check, CPR class) to start the program. 
August came around, and I just kept having a dreading feeling about it and at the end of the first week, I was pretty certain that this isnt what I want to do and was freaking out about loans going through and owing the school money before I had time to leave the program.
Thankfully, most things worked out and I was able to get out without penalties and only owing for a few books I used. The gist of it, is that i thought i could really just push myself to want to be a nurse and realized i cant.
Long story short, I still dont know what I want to do and what to even go for. I've been battling with anxiety and depression for years and although I know that's not an excuse it definitely gets in the way.
I've had a few major life changes within the last couple of years and it has kind of put me in a slump. I now live with my sister and we rent a house from my dad, and pay all other Bill's. Dad doesnt charge us much for rent, and my brother is constantly bitching about it.
My brother is a 33 year old male that lived with our mom and us basically rent free with his first daughter until he was 25. Then he met his now wife who is a nurse practitioner and he is a stay at home dad. She provides everything for him, he has the newest of everything and a nice house with land. So went from living with my mom to that, which he clearly didnt work for himself.
So he puts me down. Talks about me not having a degree, or good job. He probably talks about the kind of car I drive or phone I have.. he does all behind my back and tries to act like best friends to my face.
We used to be close, it just hurts. I dont understand why he judges me when he literally has everything he wants. I already have low self esteem and dont feel great about not accomplishing much in my life and it just feels like a slap in the face.

Me and this girl (18) did everything together. Like she was literally my rock. We spent everyday together, we went skating together, went on adventures, family trips, you name it we did it. She was my best friend and I’m still in love with her. I know I am young but I really feel/ felt an amazing connection with her. We broke up about 3 weeks ago. Im definitely not over it yet, but I’ve learned a lot of things. 

1. Don’t be too reliant on somebody. Be able to solve problems yourself. 
2. Be able to be alone sometimes. Don’t spend all your excess time waiting for them to come back from whatever they are doing (like shopping or at work, etc) 
3. Do things for yourself. Have your own separate dreams and aspirations. 
4. Have you own time for hanging out with friends, time alone, time for work, time for your passion.

Things don’t always work out. Like I really thought I was going to marry this girl. She was perfect. We were perfect. Now we are nothing. And that’s okay! Yes it hurts, it actually kills. I do want to cry if I think too much about it. I want to break things. That’s going to happen. Life keeps going forward and you have to as well. Nothing is promised in life. You need to appreciate things for what they are. Always choose the positive route if possible. 

Don’t ever beg someone to stay. If they really want to they will make it work. Begging someone won’t actually influence them change how they feel. In my case, it just proved the point she was trying to make. If something isn’t working, you be respectful and mature. It goes a lot further then getting all upset and spam calling them and begging for them to stay. 

Be strong. You got this. You are okay. We all go through this kind of stuff. I still am going through it. We can do it together. 

In the meantime, get a job (or work more), hang out with friends, make new friends, join clubs at school,  put more effort into homework/ tests, think about what you want for your future. 

Something’s I’ve been doing since my breakup, I’ve been working a lot at my new job. I’m saving up money to keep getting tattoos and maybe buy a car I can work on (I have a passion for cars and tattoos lol), I’ve been hanging out with my buddies a lot especially over this break from school, I’ve joined a few dating sites just because I can.

Last summer I worked an internship at a relatively well known company. However, I felt very much like being here was very depressing. The projects were very stale, I had very little mentorship from my peers and was even criticized a few times for not knowing some things. I was put into a lab room as my own space when even other interns got their own cubicles/mentors helping them out. I tried my best and definitely learned a lot compared to not having an internship but i mostly felt very uncomfortable working here and don't want to return if i don't have to. I have been using this as a big selling point for myself and have made it sound like the best thing since sliced bread. Interviews have been coming in a lot because of it and at some point i may finally get another job but it isn't guaranteed and depending on how long this takes

I may need a contingency plan which would be either going for a part time job for a few months to help pay rent, cancel my rent altogether and pay a few months in advance to cancel and just sit it out for a while trying to find something better, or keep my rent and go back to my old company.

The boss did say to call him if I'm looking for a job and while nothing is set in stone and i could very well be stabbed in the back, he generally did like me enough to consider coming back since from what i can tell the turnover rate for the company has been high recently.

What seems to be the best plan here? I can pay rent with my emergency fund without working for around 6 months or cancel now and save myself a headache in case i need to move somewhere else.

The thing is, no one really cares about me, no one speaks to me, I cant remember the last time someone asked me if I wanted to do something, hangout or just someone who wanted to exchange words with me, not the other way around. My parents do not ask me how my day is, how that test went, tell me to study, and I ussualy only exchance a word or two with my parents a day, that being them telling me its dinner. Since no one cares, I dont really have any motivation to do anything, in addition to this, I am one of those good-lazy students. Without studying I still get better than 80% of my peers on assignments and tests. In short one could say that I have been given ultimate freedom, as no one really cares, I can do what I want. The problem is I got no motivation to do anything, I dont care about myself really. There is nothing worthwhile I see chasing if it is only for myself.

Any advice / support would be massively appreciated as I navigate this “wicked” situation. Wicked in that it’s a workmen’s comp process, meaning I’m locked into a specific track of rather aggressive  “treatment” episodes until the end of the process. These are things like acupuncture, very minimal physical therapy (e.g., using rubber bands to strengthen core muscles, etc.). 

The injury: a structural issue now causing severe and debilitating pain, a thoracic spinal “kink” (a variety of issues) that makes sitting excruciating. An MRI of the internal damage is astonishing to see, because one wonders how I can stand at all from pain / trauma. 

As far as quality of life (from pain from the back), standing is better; laying down is best. Ice packs on rotation in the fridge have been a mild help (if the room I’m renting has heat that day). Bio freeze (topical chemical cooling gel) has been helpful. 

Also, I’m really worried about my family and some family friends (current landlord and step-dad’s buddy) because we’ve drifted apart since an episode in May of 2020, when I was living in a rather “incestuous” and informal living situation, as well: a micro-studio the size of a jail cell owed by friends of my landlord stepfather. 

Making matters worse, I was working for my landlord’s friend (a lawyer now in prison), and they are all friends. 

This makes all my interactions with any of them very difficult and awkward. Let’s just say, given their associations and police records, I wouldn’t want to go camping or hunting with any of these “gentlemen.” 

I was eventually pressured to go to a therapist by the company I worked for after my ex-boss was embroiled in a painful and embarrassing episode. All staff were shocked to the core about the trajectory of the company’s very mission. So I went to “therapy,” explaining my deepest pains, etc. to an overweight woman in shockingly yellow teeth explain that I needed a convertible car “like her” and then I’d be happy. The thing is, I was there for work, to address the awkwardness caused by my boss, not because I felt that materialism was something I needed to be reminded of. In any event, that therapist went on to charge me for several recurring ghost visits set up by their recurring online system; I, of course, never went back and was disgusted by their treatment of other clients on the Yelp page for the organization. 

Back to explaining the situation with my family, they apparently want separation and are making up lies and distortions as part of a style of fighting dirty that they are known for. When I say they, I really mean my step father who is a landlord and has said horrible things about tenants (racially, etc.), for example, that “black people’s trash smells differently,” how to evict tenants because you don’t like there internet habits, other sneaky landlord tricks to win (i.e., get value from / beat the tenant in some way). We’ve, obviously, butted heads since I’ve met the guy, especially because of a profound hypocrisy we’re he’d year-after-year call me a faggot, fight with and my mother in alcoholic rages (which resulted in numerous Alcoholics Anonymous and police calls to their last house). My goal is to love and honor my mother, to protect her and serve God. Jesus tells us to follow him and feed his sheep. Moses tells us to honor our parents. 

Unfortunately, COVID-19 has changed everything, as during the pandemic my mom’s fear peaked: She called me daily at work, or right before work saying, “I know in my hear of hearts you are going to kill yourself.” She said this over and over, until I rudely responded with, “F*ck you,” and worse, pleading urgently with her to stop the abuse. Next thing I knew, the police were at my place asking me questions. In other words, it was obviously some ploy by my family to intervene in my life. My step father has berated me about things like receiving jury duty notices, saying “What’s this?!” regarding an envelope he assumes has some negative news about me, because that’s how he thinks of me. 

As far as I’m concerned, it’s all projection. His concerns flow from his outlook on life. He feels unworthy because his family (rich and powerful real estate, etc. magnates in Baja California and Southern California with family members and friends in the criminal justice system, e.g., his sister and cousin). In other words, this dispute is an unfair one.

Lately I’ve been trying to follow Christ. It’s not always easy, but it has helped with the surreal nature of living with a disability — staying in the game, as it were. Some goals:

1) Be a man: spiritual union (wife / marriage). Make a home, and start a family. 

2) Honor and take care of my mom and dad. 

3) Follow Him / Feed His sheep. 

4) Heal from back and abdomen trauma (mind, body, and soul). 

5) Thrive (wealth so as to help my tribe and others). 

6)  The wisdom with which to do so.

This meant leaving my family and friends back home, but at the time it meant a wealth of new opportunities. I made all sorts of new friends and felt like I was taking a walk on the wild side. Throughout this time, I didn't really do anything to build up my actual career because I was vaguely certain me and all my comedy buds were gonna make it in some way, shape, or form. It sounds crazy but when you're in that environment, earning a living from this crazy thing you all do seems to be a matter of *when* not *if.* I dated many awesome people during this time, but was afraid to fully commit to any of them because I had a warped view on relationships and was worried about being tied down.

A few years into this life, the dream of it all started to die and I started recognizing that I wanted something more concrete. I started focusing on my work in dentistry and started to work towards applying to dental school. I started to distance myself from my comedy friends a bit and started to feel the city wasn't for me. I had vague ideas of moving to another state.

The pandemic hit and after several months of unemployment I decided to actually make moves and leave Chicago. I had a solid job there and a ton of friends that suggested I think about it more but I was certain and ended up leaving after a few months of saving up.

It's been almost two years and I have really been struggling here. When I moved to Chicago, I made friends pretty quickly and became integrated into the city in no time. Here, I've struggled to meet people and find I don't really fit in with the city's culture. Of course, being in the midst of the pandemic hasn't helped but I also think being almost 30 has been a part of it. I've made some great friends through my work, but most of them are a bit older than me and have families so they're not super available. Many of the hobbies people get into here are too expensive for my budget. I'm starting to get the sense that I missed out on love when I was younger and that it will be increasingly difficult to meet a partner, especially with the current lack of stability in my life. I know it's not healthy, but I'm also spending what is probably too much time on social media. Seeing old friends doing cool things, building wealth, getting married, etc., is messing with me. I've missed out on more than I can list with my family back home from being away so long. These are all costs of the choices I've made, but I wasn't expecting to face them all at once like this. 

The one benefit of my time here is that I've been able to focus solely on my dental school plans and am applying this upcoming June. I do not want to stay where I am, but if I were to get into the state school here, I can not pass up on in-state tuition. I'm also applying to a school in my hometown as well as some other more ""affordable"" dental schools.

I so desperately want to move back to Chicago but with my dental school timeline, it wouldn't make sense, especially since I am not applying to the school they have there. I could hold off on applying to dental school another year to move back and re-situate myself and get in-state residency, but I'm already relatively old for a dental school applicant and it just wouldn't be wise to put off applying longer. Not to mention, none of these moves have any guarantee of actually getting into dental school. 

I'm not sure exactly what my question is here. I guess I could just use some external perspective. I made choices with costs and I feel like I'm facing them all at once now. I had some cool experiences with my choices but I'm moving into my thirties without any of the things people typically have. I know you aren't supposed to compare yourself with others, but it is so hard not to. I also know life doesn't just like ""end"" in your thirties but I do feel like there are certain life milestones that get harder and harder to hit in your thirties. 

Sorry for the word salad. I just feel like I could use some perspective or encouragement if anybody has some.

I'm 38 and notoriously worried about my age.  Also worried that if I ""sacrifice"" to fully master the culinary stuff and survive as a cook, then my other passions/ambitions, would bite the dust.
















I am a ""musician"" and am interested in improving as much as I can at congas, djembe, and dundun studies.








I live in Tallahassee Florida and work at a pizza place.  I have worked part time in kitchens my entire adult life as I struggle to finish school.








I have an undergraduate degree in anthropology and a huge passion for book learning as well.








I am wondering if I could study music at music school too, but I don't know, it's only something I've been learning with locals that do congas and African drums.  It's not something I have ever done at a pro level but it's nice to dream about ""being a musician""








I don't know what the good idea is for me to do.








, I know a few Trinis, Nigerians, Senegalese, Haitians, African drummers, all over the world through Facebook.








I am not that good at being professional.  I have rather weak work history and experience although I have worked part time in kitchens my entire adult life.  I also struggle with a schizophrenia like condition and get disability income.  I'm on some medicine that is helping my mental health.  Probably if we had the medicine figured out ten years ago, I would have had less problems.








It's complicated for me.








I kind of want to get better and move deeper into society, I also wonder if I could move to Trinidad anytime soon.








My book interests is Jung, German philosophy, African and Caribbean literature, classic and modern cultural anthropology, psychoanalysis, critical theory, books on the occult.  Esp interested in folk tantra in India and related areas, sufism,Kabalah, western esoteric tradition, gnosticism, obeah, ifa, amengasie gorovudu, Mami wata, vodun, and kongolese religion.








Thanks for hearing me out!








I'm interested especially in very ritzy froufrou central European food like stuff pastries in the book KAFFEEHAUS and PLACHUTTA.








I also love the Yucatan and Mercados cookbooks each one by the same chef.








I'm half central European myself and we are naturally very into food culture








So duck fat rhubarb pies, malakoff tortes, and Damson dumplings alongside the Trini food like doubles, karhi with shrimp, Saheena, barbadine ice cream, and guava wine








I'm interested in Nigerian, Japanese, Senegalese, and Chinese food and pharmacopeia too.  Who isn't?




















My letter:








Hello Professor,












I am probably going to blow it by sharing too much but here goes, I hope this isn't too inappropriate...












I think cooking is my calling, like restaraunt experience, plus a blog




Cafe with bookstore? I don't know








I dont know if I could teach classes and grade papers












My dad is ..., former chair of fsu physics...












I don't know what other sort of work is available for someone with a PhD in Caribbean religious anthropology studies








My gpa is 2.81








I had a severe schizophrenia








That's why I am such a madman on facebook, and reddit and Quora, it's a forum where I can interrogate anyone.








I try to find out why it happened








I complain....  No girlfriend in the last fourteen years, not even a one night stand.  Sorry to share, but it's very depressing.








I ask ifa priests and vodou priests and obeah guys about my mental madness, I thought I sold my soul to devil, it's kinda scary












I am never satisfied with their answers, I long to learn more about ifa and obeah...












But I'm half Austrian, I must Duolingo German because growing up in Florida made me strongly identify with my black and Caribbean friends.  No joke!  I lost most of the German I had as a child.








I believe the ww2 energy and trauma, and black history and trauma, the cosmic horror spirit is manifest possibly in my psyche, so maybe I should be scared of the almighty and terrible...




















I guess the point of this email is that I like reading Sylvia wynter, Anthony bogues, David Graeber and Maurice godelier, Sidney Mintz, Edgar mittleholtzer, maryse conde, Earl Lovelace and Amos tutuola, David Scott and yarimar bonilla and Michel Rolph Trouillot etc, but it's so shocking to read these things especially now.








It's this tremendous secret I walk with, I feel like these books and radical anthropology could really be a revolutionary process, big time, and that besides wanting to feel educated is one of the things that draws me.








But I don't know if I should really even think about gradschool, I hope sometime when you are not so busy you can feedback








I can go on and on, but I wanted to explain some things and ask some questions

Currently, I'm a 20-year-old college student at a community college and just as many cases, I'm highly unsure what I want to major in. I'll be blunt, I've failed calculus 3 times and cannot retake it anymore and that pressure alone has been hard on me because while I don't want to find a career involving math, I want to find something that I enjoy as a career and a lot of what I've enjoyed and been told I'm good at involves the sciences or technology which generally require minimum calculus. I've been told and heard many times that I shouldn't let failures bring me down, ""It's only temporary"" they've said, but I can't help but beat myself up over it. 

It kills me mentally to realize how behind I'm becoming when it comes to life, my little brother is about to start college, and man that messed me up when I realized that ill only be a year ahead of him when we are 3 years apart. The idea that I can't help but think every time is how if I had just decided on a major, focused my hardest on school, and passed all my classes, how I'd be in a much better place right now. How I'd be closer to my goal of becoming an adult and living my life how I want without the parental restrictions I've had on me my entire life of when to sleep or how much I can play games just stuff along those lines. And this is a common theme but I can't help but again, hurt myself over it. ""You could've been better"" ""Why aren't you fixing your life?"" ""Become a fucking adult already, why aren't you?""""You've messed up your life already"". I wish I could just pass through school in a snap so I can get on with my life, I hate having to put myself through this education just to make sure I get this piece of paper from a good school that will get me my happiness of a good job that I truly enjoy. I just want to move back to my friends, to live on my own with no restrictions, because that is what I find makes me happy and right now I have none of that. Half the reason I play games anymore is to feel something and/or to interact WITH my friends that I can no longer be with in person every day.

I wish I could instantly change my habits, I've tried but I haven't been able to and always have resorted to reverting to my old ones. I play games and a lot of them, it's the only stuff that makes me happy anymore and the majority of the time because I'm on with my friends. I don't want to cut this out of my life but it's being told to me that eventually, I have to give it up. I love games and anime, but I can't just get rid of it so easily. I've tried to cut back on it but eventually I just go back to postponing everything else for it and never get anything done. I know if I had self-control I'd be well on my way to my desired future, I WANT TO BE SELF CONTROLED. But i've tried, I've tried so hard to just drop my entertainment to work on my future but every time I come back. I hate this part of me, I have the desire to fucking do something but NEVER do it. I wish I'd just act on my want to become a person I see but I don't and it fucks me up. And I cry constantly because of this, it's painful to see myself not become or actually work towards being who I see I wanna become.

Lastly, as it's been seen as a common theme, I beat myself up constantly over everything. I've been told everything in the book about how unhealthy it is, and how I could change this. But nothing has ever seemed to help, I just hate myself for not being able to be my own ""correct"", for failing calc, for being behind, for not becoming who I know I could be. I quite literally cuss myself out about everything I do, leading me to worry about my ties and bonds to everything around me, such as a friend just briefly leaving after a tough game and I go and overreact believing it was my fault and panic...etc. I know eventually once I'm in a place where I have a good job, live by myself well, and am able to enjoy my life how I want it, I'll be fine. But I'm having trouble even believing I will get there, I can't even take the max like 18 credits because of how much I don't focus my life and dedicate to studying, I may WANT to do that but I don't. And I hate that I don't, And I want to change but I can't because I know I'll just go back to playing games all day and wasting money on classes and failing them because I didn't study at all. I hate all this about myself and just wish I could be better. It's all so painful and I wish I could just have it all fixed already because it's gotten to a point where I feel nothing but pain every day about everything when I used to be so happy with my life. Now I can't help but believe that every smile I give is just fake because I honestly don't know if and what makes me happy anymore. 

Anyways thanks for reading, I know it's a mess of a post, I didn't know how else to write it out because I was just sporadically typing out my feelings. I apologize if this is another common situation of a kid who just got out of high school a couple of years ago situation I just know I'm not the only one feeling this kind of stuff but I can't help but feel like it's just me feeling this way, since well I'm the one hurting as I'm typing this ofc not trying to disregard their feelings, anyways it's a weird thing that I'm sure there's a scientific word for it that describes our sole existences and how we perceive it over others like a ""woe is me"" sorta thing.

From a young age my dad was a severe alcoholic to the fact that my first memory of him was being beat in the shed in the back yard (he has been sober for 6 years now but still battles with depression) before my dad sobered up he use to beat my eldest brother a lot really but it was not the I’m going to beat you with a belt but rather I’m gonna chase you round the house with a frying pan

At school I never really had friends and it was not like I was an incredibly weird kid I was just scrambled in the head like I could not hold a social situation in the slightest out of fear that it would end up with me getting beat up.

I hooked up with a girl twice and we kind of dated a couple of times? Then she ended up saying she wasn't in a good place mentally to be in a relationship after she called me ""her boyfriend"", and we broke it off, I understood and no hard feelings. However, deep down I couldn't help but feel it had to with my lack of experience with women in general, or something I said/did wrong... I certainly liked her and would have kept seeing her.

And I've not tried since. I thought why bother, it costs me time/money to try and if its just going to be that I'm too incompetent to be valued by a girl, why ever start trying to find someone? I should try and get my feet under me career wise and just focus on that.... right? So I thought. Now I'm questioning everything.

To delve deeper into my mindset for ease of explaining how I'm feeling to you, I just want to lay out how my life has been so far: I went to high school and during that, I decided on a career path I wished to pursue. So, I went to school for a related degree and diploma far away from my home, and worked in that career field very close to home through all 4 summer seasons while attending school, and now I am graduated, and it's looking a lot like I am going to have a job with the same organization I have been with for the past 4 years. It may be a few years before that becomes full-time work, say 4-5 years..

So why is that relevant? The biggest reason this is relevant to me has been my cycle of being close to home in the summers, but moving away the rest of the year for school. It just never felt to me like a relationship could ever take hold given this nomadic way I had been living. So I never tried... I look back in disgust, so many attractive women did show interest in me but I was always someone who wanted to get to know people first... Now that I am done school and probably wont ever be around that many women my age ever again... Reality is setting in for me. I feel behind my peers in terms of being able to communicate with women in a sexual/relationship manner because I decided to never take a chance, owing it to being a ""waste of time"" and that I needed to focus on school and studying as opposed to partying/hooking up.  

So now I live at home with my parents, however I have been offered one job far away from my home, and I will be interviewing for several jobs locally in the coming weeks. I am happy. My life feels on track. I'm realizing I have really been alone because me, that's my fault. I never put any effort in. And I've been hesitant to put any effort in these past few months because ""well I need to find work, get settled into a place and out of my parents first, need to wait until that turns into a full-time job, etc before a girl will even bother with me""... And that is my destructive mindset I guess... I feel I could never be liked because I'm still ""a boy"" in society, I still don't have my ""feet under me"" so I shouldn't be dating yet.... right?

See my issue? I tell myself I shouldn't put any effort into it until this is done first, then that done, then this. Even just these past few weeks, I've been saying to myself  ""well no, don't make a tinder profile yet because you need to go for a run first today, and do some workouts, and make some food, and this and that and yaddah yaddah you get the idea""... 


Thing is, if I move out for that job I was offered away from home, I will revert back to my mindset of ""no point getting invested because I will just be gone in a few months time""... Then that job I would be taking is not conducive to dating at all (basically grunt work, camp job, , remote area, working 12+hours 7 days/week)..... And I wouldnt be trying to date out there because ""im just going to move back home after anyway"" (work is seasonal).


Am I denying myself to much that it hinders me? Or, perhaps now really isn't a good time until I figure out which job I will take, but my mindset is skewed because I feel I've ""missed out"" in previous years? I really feel I want ot meet someone, and not to ""complete me"" but because well... Sex and connection are nice right? I don't want to go through life alone, and while that shouldn't pressure me into dating just to ""fill a void""... Eventually I have to start. I am comfortable with myself. I know what I like, my hobbies, my passions.. I just want to meet someone? So why not start now, as I've been delaying it my whole life to the point I feel hindered in my social abilities? Do I sound like a crazy person to you all? Am I overthinking the fact that I stay with my parents right now? I have the means to move out and money saved I figure it just doesn't make sense until my job starts (I have income right now in other forms). Surely someone out there my age would understand that?

What do you all think.... Anything is appreciated. I feel I've been alone too long, and am getting a bit complacent with it.

I have a college degree in Computer Science and have been working for two years, and for two different employers in two different cities. The first one was in a city 600km away from where I grew up. The second one (the current one) is pretty close to my home town.

One week into the first job, I instantly noticed that working 40h/week in a mentally challenging job is very exhausting. Additionally, all the non-stop stitting in front of a screen was more draining than I thought.
Corona hit just a month after I started working.
I was stressed out, missed my friends and family and was suffering from sports injuries (mostly tense muscles and inflamed tendons). After one year I quit the job.
I thought it were the circumstances that made me miserable, not the job itself.

So I moved back closer to home and took another 40h/week job in IT. 
In the beginning eveything was cool. The new job seemed exciting and I was happy to be back with my family and friends.
Now, one year later, I am starting to experience similar symptoms than the year before.
My motivation is at an all time low. I don't enjoy programming anymore. All the sitting and staring at a screen in a concrete building makes me sick.
Every day just try to get through. 

I am craving for a non-desk job. 
My current dream is to open a moutainbike shop, as I always have been into outdoor and moutainbike stuff.
However, to open a bike shop, you need to be a bike-mechanic, which takes 3 years to learn.

I really want to do the moutainbike thing.
Although I am afraid, that I might not like it in the end or fail to make a living when being self-employed.

I know that I should be grateful to have a job at the moment. And I know that I am privileged to even consider this option.
But I feel miserable about my job at the moment.
I feel like I have persued something that does not make me happy for 7 years.

I literally am getting by day by day because I have an 18mth old to take care of (from previous marriage) - and can’t let her needs go uncared for because of my depression.

TL;DR - ghosted by my (32f) ex (30m) of 5mths two weeks before Valentine’s Day. I found out I was broken up with via social media (he never called/texted me, he removed me from his page, unfriended me and changed his status to single). He then called himself “coming back” the day after Valentine’s Day stating that he never broke up with me and why would I think that 😒 I went to the bathroom to cry (because he made me feel crazy for crying in front of him) and while there, I thought I’d take a pregnancy test. Random as all fuck, I know. And sure enough as life would fucking have it - I’m pregnant. Sad thing is, the first thing I thought of was terminating the pregnancy. I just couldn’t fathom having a baby by him and having to deal with his narcissistic behavior for the rest of my life. Anywho, I didn’t tell him for the whole day that I found out. I just stared at him.  Eventually told him that night and he feigned excitement and said how we could be a family (ummmm excuse me, not the man who just ghosted me?!) 🙄

Ohhhhhhkay, so fast forward to last Saturday- I woke up in a sweat and watched him laying next to me absolutely disgusted with myself. The the point of nausea. I realized I absolutely can not sit there and pretend I was okay with any of this. I was severely hurt, and rejected. So I spoke up. And I said what I needed from him to make this relationship to work: his time, attention, for him to stop stonewalling/gaslighting me and for him to communicate effectively. That’s it. Sad that I didn’t even say “love” smh. He kept cutting me off and replied angrily saying he treat me the way he do because I put him out before (like weeks ago after a bad argument where he called me a bad mom..etc) but WHY am I still being punished for that? I even apologized a million times. I still didn’t withhold love and affection.
Never ghosted him.. never not cared if I didn’t speak to him for days.. smh. 

So that argument happened and I simply said to him “I won’t let this be my life. Yes, I love you - but I can’t continue to love you more than I love myself. I have children to now care for and mentally/emotionally I have to be as WHOLE as I can be for them.” His response was more gaslighting and he said “If you want to leave me like people in my life usually do, then oh I get it. I’ll leave you alone.” 

Those words hurt but only because I knew he meant none of it and honestly just wanted an out - and because I gave him one, he could finally leave unscathed and with less guilt. Me saying that to him was exactly what he wanted. 

I realized after I said my speech and he didn’t even fight for me, I was going to be a single mom.

I have to now raise this man’s baby 💔

I blocked him on the every thing the moment he left my house. I washed my hands. I did have his email and emailed him a history of my appointments regarding the baby. Nothing else. Then I blocked his email. I’ll open it back up if I need to tell him anything important regarding the health of the baby.

I never felt so low.. and stupid in my life. I am so embarrassed about this that you all on Reddit are the only people I’ve told (outside of him). Can’t believe i let this master manipulator impregnate me. I am terrified to tell my family and friends. 

Finally my question: any advice you have for me? After reading the dumpster fire that is my life? I don’t know why it took for me to get pregnant to want to do something with my life.. to find a”purpose”. But here I am - begging the kind strangers of Reddit for some type of help.

I never had the energy to look for something different and I always thought that once my dad's business gets back on track, I would  take a break and start thinking about my life. But that never happened. Obviously I am not getting paid. That was the whole point. To have an employee without a salary because of how bad his business is going. I just get to live in the house and eat. I have no money of my own and what I had had from my grandparents I had to give it to my parents to help them out. At home I have to help my mother with keeping the house clean since she always complains about her back or her health in general. Overall I have no life of my own.

When I was 5 he would lock me in the car out in the garage over night without any food and only when my aunt or grandma saw me would I be let out, he would hit me, beat me, emotionally abuse me, steal my money I earned for myself, and almost broke my nose at one point. It was only when my mom found out and CPS was called that he stopped, but only for a time. He would also abuse and beat my mom too. He would have her pull out egregious loans in her name and then he wouldn't have the money to pay them back, making her credit drop to the shitter. Every time he abused her and she tried to get out of his grip he would be the one to call the police, he would gaslight them, and her, instead of him, would be getting arrested and charged, thus wrecking allot of Job opportunities for her. He cheated on her at first and my mom forgave him for a bit, but then my mom did it once after him in retaliation and he freaked out over it. Fast forward to today and he's back in his old ways. He had us fooled that he had changed but he hadn't changed at all. Right after my mom got a stage 3b lung cancer diagnosis me and her found out that he'd been having an affair for around 3 months, and he refused to stop talking to her, even for my 3 siblings (which are his kids). We then found out that he'd been depositing numerous fraudulent checks into secret bank accounts he had with thousands of dollars in them. After all this ensued he started getting angry, bitter, and abusive again. He tried gaslighting the cops like he used to always do, but this time I was old enough to know what was going on. He got escorted out of the house for the night, but nothing happened, then he got physical with my mom again, but this time my sister recorded everything AND they got my eyewitness testimony. He got arrested that morning until the next day. And that one was the last straw. After that he just walked out. He blamed me and my mom for everything, took all the money, and just left. And now he refuses to pay rent, even after we got an eviction notice, and he just doesn't care that his dying wife and kids are going to be homeless. And I'm only 18. How am I supposed to take care of my dying mom and raise my siblings with nothing but Chinese restaraunt money and a shitty car? And on top of this I go to college with 51% of the curriculum finished, and if I back out now, I have to pay the full 17 thousand, so I can't exactly go full time at my job. Plus I have a felony case being railed against me from another state just for kicking a car and denting it, even though I offered to pay the damages. I'm terrified of just waking up tomorrow and finding out the next terrible thing that's gonna happen. It just doesn't seem to end. And there's no help. We've tried government programs, but the wait list is years long, we're trying a pro Bono but the courts are so slow. How do we survive this? How can I make my family safe again?

I had a very rough childhood. Not gonna tell sob stories, just providing background information, and trying to illustrate that ""playing it safe"", finishing High School, going to college, etc, wasn't quite an option that was dealt in my cards. I had to drop out and move out young.   


None of which matters now. What matters is that I'm 26 and in a completely redundant rhythm of low income jobs and renting rooms from strangers. I essentially have no family. Certainly no one that can or would lend any kind of aid to me pursuing progress. I've hardly ever even owned a car because the low income job trap is ridiculously difficult to escape once you become dependent on it (No speeches on ""just get a better job"" please, it doesn't quite work that way irl). I make about 15$/hr, which considering I was born near the beach in Florida, hardly pays rent. Any time a car of mine experienced any serious problems, it was out of the realm of possibilities to shell out money for it. I walk almost an hour to work everyday, and if I'm lucky I can catch a ride home. Otherwise I'm walking in the dark another hour. 

I haven't had a relationship of any kind since a short-lived engagement when I was 20 during a brief period where I was doing ALRIGHT, but not great. Haven't had a car since shortly after this time. I'm a reasonably attractive man in all reality, and I'm quite an extraordinarily talented guitarist (enough so that I felt it merited it's place in this post). I use to be quite charming, but after having no social life for so many years it seems to have faded. Charming is also not to be confused with confidence either: I can not approach strangers, especially women, and have never shown interest or asked out a girl that I wasn't 100% sure would say yes beforehand. All of my former friendships and relationship were lingering from when I was still in school, and slowly died out over the years as connections fizzled out one by one. 

I only seem to have ""bedroom confidence"", for lack of a better term (as in, I look in the mirror and go ""oh wow I'm not bad looking at all"", or ""hey look I'm like REALLY good at this instrument"", or ""if I ever sleep with a girl again she's gonna be absolutely enthralled with me"" (I'm very thankful for what I've received in this department),  but this all goes out the window ENTIRELY the moment I'm in front of another human being). I haven't had any friends or social life since I was about 21. Literally, no one messages me. No one calls me. I don't talk to anyone regularly or honestly ever. If something happened to me, my job would realistically be the only place that would even notice. I've completely fallen off the face of the earth for nearly 5 years, and this isolation has become a crippling weight on the entirety of my being.

The only advice I've ever gotten (online, of course) is ""get over it"", which is *INCREDIBLY* unhelpful. I've been so far removed from the world that simple social interactions are the hardest part of my day. My entire existence has become hinged around making enough money to get through the week, make sure to have alcohol on a daily basis when I get home (every day without fail for years now), and make sure my guitar is in working order so I can vent my feelings to it about 40-60 hours a week (basically every free moment that I can responsibly afford, even often neglecting hours of sleep a night to continue playing).

 I'm completely incapable of engaging new people, I've even tried online methods like Tinder (which is apparently a joke for men if you're not a super muscular Fabio-type guy, and even when I did get matches I quickly ruined them through attempting conversation). I feel like I'm never going to have a friend or girlfriend again in my life to be brutally honest, and I've sadly even began to come to terms with that. All I can do is sit around and wait for something to happen. But of course it never does, and it never will. Because life doesn't come to people who wait. It hurts every aspect of my soul to watch everyone around me progress and succeed and be happy in even the smallest of ways, while I've made absolutely no progress whatsoever as I've stagnated for years on end. I sit down every day and think of things I can do to better myself, and none of them seem like options to me. Because options either cost money, which I don't have, consume time, which I rarely have during useful hours, since I work monday through friday from early morning until late afternoon, which surprisingly eliminates vast amounts of things from my realm of possibilities. (Going to a dentist requires scheduling days off, getting a haircut takes serious planning, I can't even go to the bank because i work 100% of banking hours, etc), or is completely impractical without a car, which I can't seem to get without breaking one of the other cycles I'm stuck in.   


I honestly debate the worth of life on a daily basis. There's only a few things keeping me here and  continuing with it, but sadly they're very very important things and bailing on life just isn't an option I'm willing to consider, unfortunately for me, because it would be a lot easier. Which leads me to feel like I really do *want* to be happy. I *want* to have friends. I *REALLY* want to hear someone tell me they love me again (It's fucking incredible how much people take that for granted, until you haven't even heard it half-heartedly from a family member for 6 years. It takes a real toll on your entire being.) I'd also like to not cry on a daily basis. I'd like to improve myself, to fix this. To get out of this rut. I keep coming back to ""it starts with your job"", because I can't do many things without a car, and no woman even worth having a conversation with would take someone seriously who makes as little as I do even if I did have a car, and until I have my own place (which is impractical without a degree in this day in age) I'm not even going to feel like a real man. I feel like I've been completely crushed by the system (not to blame it, I'm just experiencing the sum of the parts I was given and/or able to put into it) and that recovering my life to the point of being worth anything is gone. Not because of my age, but because of the cycle I've fallen into. To make it worse, my job involves driving around (alone, of course, thus promoting my isolation further and removing the one place people generally have to interact with others) and servicing/repairing pools, which means I'm constantly in the vicinity of people's nice homes and witnessing the results of their nice jobs and nice lives and overhearing their lovely conversations and observing all these things I wish I had. I see their children and I think of how lucky they are to have a chance from the start. I see their extra cars parked off in the yard and their outdoor bars and their nice decks and it just all pushes me further into this depressive wormhole.  


I honestly don't even know what I'm asking. I don't think there's a real answer that gets me out of this situation anymore, or I would have stumbled upon it by now. I can't afford to take chances because if I fail I end up homeless, I can't just call mommy and move back in for a little because something ""didn't work out."" In fact last I heard my mother lives in a car with some guy, does meth, and drinks a handle of whisky every day. But Hell, at least she has a car and a significant other, right?   


Maybe ""get over it"" is the only advice for me. If someone can lay out exactly how to put that into action though, that'd be great. Because as it stands I really don't even know how to do THAT.

So lets back track to when I was 18 years old.
I had no idea what I wanted to study in university.
I'm the youngest of 3, with an older brother and sister who are very smart high achievers.
I was always the one who would fail in school, get suspended.
I was diagnosed with adhd in grade 2 and my parents being immigrants refused to even believe in it and refused medication.
So I really struggled in school my entire life.
In 12th grade, my mom made me feel like if I didn't go to university I was a failure in her eyes.
I literally had no choice. I wasn't even allowed to do a leap year.
The only things I cared about and was good at was art and fitness. I was always a gifted schetcher since I was young, and I was obsess with fitness. I also loved english class. When it came to everything else, I completely sucked. I pretty much had to try more than everyone else in every subject to get even an A- or even a B+.
English and art I would get high marks because it was easy for me.
I was always great at creating creative artwork and writing.
I went to uni for liberal arts. I took this elective in the first year called English and cultural studies and I liked it a lot and decided that's what I should study.
I also ended up gravitating towards creative writing around the same time.
When second-year rolled around, I was an English major.
I liked it a lot and did well in the first semester. By second semester, I started doing horrible. I went from and A avg in first to a C-. My energy was really low and I kept getting sick. I ended up getting diagnosed with cancer 3 months into the second semester. I had to defer all my classes and start treatment. I missed 3 semesters in a row.
I came back to school and my mental clarity and cognition was terrible. I suffered from a condition called chemo-brain, which is this terrible brain fog. My mom made me rush back to uni because she was afraid I would never finish. I went back earlier than I should have and somehow scraped by and graduated a couple of years later.
I graduated during the 2020 pandemic.
During the pandemic up until 2021, I could not get a job at in my field at all, because there really isn't any work for people with bachelor's degrees in English. I had to do some sort of a post-graduate program. 
So I entered a technical writing program and did a semester. I hated it so much. This field is great, but it's the type of writing I hate so much. What I always wanted to do, was write novels. I just wanted some sort of skill that gave me money as I did this.
So I dropped out after doing a semester and never went back.
I pondered what I would do for almost a year and somehow ended up in paramedic school.
I got into this program only because of how much money they make and because of how fast they make money.
I had/have zero passion for this field. I'm now in the second semester and I'm pretty much about to fail.
This program is so damn hard and I already have zero passion for it.
It's all these classes I always sucked at.

I'm probably gonna be outta this program in a couple weeks.
I'm turning 26 next month.
I have no money, no valuable life skill that can generate me wealth, I still live at home with my parents, I have a bunch of debt.

The only thing I got going for me right now is an English degree, a personal training job interview next week, and immense knowledge on health and fitness.
I truly believe that I will be the best personal trainer because that's what I love doing. My only doubt about this field is the fact that it doesn't pay much money. I've recently been fantasizing about wokring as a PT and just focusing on my writing.

Second year, second semester college student here, have been feeling really lonely and lost about my happiness and my life and I really know don't know what to do or think. (Sorry for the paragraphs and paragraphs, this has been bothering me and it was just time that I write this all down somewhere)

Graduated class of 2020 and knew it was going to be a rough time, but I was pretty optimistic about everything. Almost all of my friends went to a major university near us, and I got accepted to it as well, but I elected to attend another because of a good scholarship I got from them. I didn't think much about having to make new friends and socialize, I thought that would be easy considering that I had plenty of really close friends and considered myself a sociable person. And I was super excited! My parents as well as some friends I had who were older told me that college was one of the best times of their lives and that having friends and going to parties and such would be so much fun! So I went and my first year was not so great in retrospect, didn't meet any new friends but I actually met and got together pretty quickly with my current girlfriend so at least that part was great :). My roommate had never showed up and while I tried to befriend other people in my dorm and in my (online) classes, no one seemed to really click with me. I am so thankful for my girlfriend though, I think she distracted me from all of that and can't imagine having had done last school year without her.

This school year, having heard that pandemic-related restrictions to online classes were going to lighten up, gave me hope! I came to school once again, super optimistic and excited to make new friends and actually see people in class again. I had a new roommate for this semester too so that was super exciting, I was ready to have another buddy! After having some serious incompatabilities with my roommate leading us to go different ways, the dorm I was in was switched and I ended up moving to a single room elsewhere. I also have been trying to make friends here, but everyone seems to want to completely keep to themselves so I haven't been successful. In my in-person classes, I made sure to reach out and try to talk to people, but once again no one has really clicked with me or wanted to talk about anything besides homework answers. However, I did actually manage to make one really close friend who has literally been the coolest dude ever, and were moving into an apartment next semester, so that's super exciting and I can't wait :). But since our schedules don't line up all that well, I havent been able to see my friend or my girlfriend a whole lot this school year either. 

This semester though I was determined and convinced that with a good mindset, I can make it all work and make new friends in all my new classes, but I think I just got my hopes up too high. I've been feeling pretty lost and have missed my friends, and seeing them on Snapchat all hanging out and expanding their friend group just like we did in high school has made me realize that I don't have anything like that, and I miss it. I miss having a group of friends to always be laughing and hanging out with, and I feel really lonely. Recently I just drove down there to surprise one of my best friends for his birthday, and the sense of community and closeness of them all was staggering. They talked and hung out with their neighbors and everyone was so friendly to one another, it was fantastic. I got home yesterday and immediately just felt the abscence of all of it and cried. It's all I want right now and I don't know what to do to have it. I've thought about switching schools before but I can't just leave my girlfriend or my friend here, they're in the same situation and I can't just do that to them (I also already signed the lease for the next year for our apartment so...) 

I'm sorry if this post comes off as expectant and entitled, maybe I am (please feel free to leave an honest comment I want to be truthful with myself), but I don't feel like having a few friends at school is a lot to ask for. I just wanna feel like I belong again but I feel so isolated and lonely. I don't know whether to blame my perception of it all or bad luck, but nothing feels right. I'm not excited for the future or anything really and I'm tired of trying to be so optimistic when I can't find even find a few friends to go get lunch with. Maybe I'm so strange that no one wants to be my friend, I don't even know anymore. 

At least I have my girlfriend and my buddy, I'm so thankful for them and I don't think I could've gotten this far without them.

I messed up my life early on by not pursuing a trade of any kind. 

I let parents and other family pressure me into taking a corporate job working full time for my aunt. I started the Monday after I graduated high-school. 

I live in a smallish town, and there aren't many opportunities for people without degrees here that are above minimum wage. I kept being told that if I hung in there, I could move up in the company. I couldn't afford rent, so I lived with my parents the majority of my adulthood. They kept assuring me that I'd get my aunt's job once she retired, and it would be worth it. This includes my aunt. She always told me I had a future there. 

Fast forward to today, my aunt is no longer with the company, and I have her job. Except...I didn't get anywhere near her pay. I still can't afford rent. I don't even make enough to qualify (the whole you must make at least 2x the rent rule).

So... I'm still living at home. Now the house is in my name, because both my parents' health are falling. They are retired and very poor. The house is, quite literally, deteriorating beneath our feet. I can't afford repairs in addition to household expenses and helping them pay for medical treatments. 

I've thought about going to trade school, but I'd have to quit my job to do so, plus I don't know if I could afford it on top of everything else. Student loans aren't an option, because I still owe for a failed attempt in my early 20s, besides, student loans and a part time job wouldn't be enough to cover my household expenses. 

I've applied for government assistance several times, but I'm always denied because our incomes combined is over the help threshold. They don't seem to take into account the medical expenses. 

My parents are starting to need home health nurses, and I have a lot of concerns that I could get into legal trouble for the state of the house. Meaning, with adult protective services.  

My work schedule plus commute time doesn't leave me with a whole lot of spare time for part time work. I've had a couple work from home jobs on the side, but the pay was so minimal, it didn't even cover my internet bill (I live in a semi rural area so internet is expensive). 

In other words...I f****d up. Big time. I don't even know where to go at this point. 

I need to figure out a way to make more money. Any advice is welcome. Thank you 😩",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28837,public,self,Am I stuck? Where do I go from here?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/sy4t3a/am_i_stuck_where_do_i_go_from_here/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,

Get a checklist. You want two checklists. You want one, filled with small and easy tasks, such as, floss teeth, make an origami star, pick a book to read next (but not to read it), put away THAT item thats just been in the wrong place for a while. Really small stuff, basically. I find motivation comes with momentum, by satisfying your productivity in tiny, digestible steps, you might be able to grab hold of that spark. 

Next fill in your ""big"" checklist. Put crazy big stuff on here. Write a book. Plan a road trip including petrol, distance, time and all the countries you want to go. Make a huge collage of things you like doing. Start a painting on your wall, do 1000 squats but count in a new language.

Sometimes I do small stuff, then i THROW myself into something huge. I never finish it, but it gives me my energy back for a little while. 

Another thing might be to get a job, or browse jobs you could get, or make money from home like doing freelance stuff.

Also this is a slight vent

Most of my friends are internet friends because I live in a place where queer people are more outcasted, so its easier to find other queer friends to relate to online. One day I started feeling really sad, so I deleted my social media account. I was gone for weeks that turned into months, and not a single person had texted me to ask if im okay. I suffer from mental health issues and they know about this, so I was confused why my disappearance didn't worry them, make them sad, or why they didn't seem to care. And if they did care, I wondered why they never expressed that. I see them posting funny screenshots of their texts with their friends, and it makes me wonder why they won't reach out to me. In the past when they've deleted their social media accounts I reached out to them to ask if they're okay. In the past I would be the one to initiate social interactions and hangouts (like watching tv shows together). I figured they were just shy, but the fact that they won't be the first person to text me when I disappear- for all they know I could be dead- makes me think that they never cared about me. I'm not good with social cues or understanding when someone doesn't like me because I'm autistic, and there have been times people insult me to my face and I don't even know or understand it. I feel like that might be whats happening here. 

I talked to one of them after reactivating an account for a few minutes and he said he just didn't want to bother me by texting me (same guy who is posting funny screenshots of texts with friends), another said she cares about me. This is what I don't understand. If they cared about me why don't they reach out for once, so I'm not the one doing it all the time. They say it would bother me, but I told them it doesn't and they STILL won't text me first. Even after clearing up a misunderstanding, he won't text me. I don't want to go clinging onto them, begging them to like me. I think I might have to let these people go. But I'm angry, I'm really angry that they would assume my feelings that it ""bothers me"" for others to put in a bit of work on their end. I'm also angry that it looks like I spent all this time on people who really never cared about me. I constantly struggle to fit in, and I honestly think I'm a very funny and interesting person to be around, as well as loyal and fun to hang out with (cuz i always have creative/new ideas of what to do since internet friendships can be limited). I thought that would have been enough for people, but right now it looks like they don't need me/want me. I feel sad and angry, but I don't want to tell them because they won't reach out, and that makes me feel like they don't care how I feel. Me leaving was never meant to be a test of friendship but if it was, they would have failed. 

If im being too pessimistic about this or if I did something wrong here, please tell me but try to be nice or let me down softly, I really don't feel too well. I also really just need to know who is in the wrong here and if I should talk to them or simply not waste any more of my time.

*Creative tendency and money issues:*  
I have a master's degree in performance and have had a relatively social/busy/artsy last years in the centre of the city. I finished my studies in the midst of the corona pandemic and made a digital master project (opposed to a live performance with an audience full of connections) which was well received but a huge letdown because of the anticipation I had built up years prior. The digital project was reviewed by the jury and no-one else. During lockdown I panickly tried to do this and that within the restrictions that were given but found very little opportunities as the entire art scene in my city was struggling too. There were to theatre festivals or open stages I could perform. I faced money issues after trying for a while so took on a job 4/5th a week in a flower shop and stopped persuing my career for a while. I like the job and enjoy myself but have no energy or mental space to work on art. I feel unfulfilled on a deeper level and wish I could be a full-time artist again.

*Domestic life and relationship:*  
When I was studying I thought to buy a very small boat to live on and lower my living cost to make art. But now I'm having my first real relationship. A boat is too small for us. We live in an appartement that costs way more than that boat. We both need the space to concentrate (musician + writer/performer). And in fact I don't mind the idea of sharing a cute home with a garden and a pet. But owning these things cost a lot of money and probably a lifetime of work. We could find a home outside the city to lower the cost of living, but the further away I go from the city centre, the more I'm removed from my colleauges, opportunies, possible succes as an artist.   
But it's a straightforward traject: I work in a flowershop fulltime, find a house, be content, make art in between cracks of time,... kind of feel like a loser... because of all the things that could have been. Probably feeling stuck in life here and there, at my dead-end job... Having a mid-life crisis... I realise that I am blessed with a job and a partner. But the idea of me not persuing art makes me feel like I'm wasting my life. That I could be doing better, working harder, putting in more effort.

*Nuance in decision:*  
I don't know if I'm the problem and that I should fix my perspective to be happy with the job I have. I can't really listen to my inner voice either and quit my job. I have had a few opportunities while working that I had to let go because of the job. If I would quit to take one of these (rather small) opportunities for a month or two, I'd be without income again and without a job, too. I can't repeat the process untill I've worked at every flowershop in the country. Not to mention the next generation of graduates is taking the city opportunities by storm and there is little left of allumni like me.

However, after working out for a while and just trying to live life, I've fallen into the pit of comparing myself non stop to others. Wether that be in the gym seeing all the similarly aged fit, muscular people or just in general seeing people with money to throw around or a significant other to spend their time with and help express their emotions (yeah it's almost petty I know). 

Honestly I feel as though what I'm explaining is super common and talked about/felt by others often. 

Really all I want is for someone to give me a smack in the face with a simple cold answer: How do I just, stop worrying about what people view and portray me as, so that I can take control of my mind and focus on myself? How do I 'STOP GIVING A F*CK'?

I’m currently living in central Florida. I’m thinking of moving to Calgary Canada, or Helsinki Finland.

My core reasons are;

-A healthcare system that won’t deny you care or let you die because you can’t afford overpriced care (I make good money, so I am looking into gap coverage etc. but I want to get out of the industry since it’s high stress, but feel I couldn’t afford worst case healthcare making less money)

-A more trustworthy society, researching online and combining mine and my friends numerous decades of time in central/south florida, all echo this sentiment. So many cheat in romantic relationships, business try to scam you, employers overwork and have toxic environments, etc. 

-No one takes COVID seriously, and Florida’s rates are almost always the highest in the US

I have so many wonderful friends and family here, that I’m very close to, but many of them refuse to get vaccinated, get tested, or mask, so that limits our interactions.

I’m torn between just moving a bit further out of the center of Orlando, (I’m progressive and want to be near the progressive hub of Florida) and being close to friends and family. Versus being $500-1000 and 8-15 hrs away in flights from them, but secure in a trustworthy, place where I feel safe, and don’t have to worry about worst case scenarios with healthcare.

Just wanted to ask for your advice. 

Backstory: my so (26) and his sister (40)is having a dispute over their mom's custody - both of them are adopted.  I work remotely and we decided that I stay there during the day at their house so his mom would have someone to talk to. I go home every night. Fast forward, his sister decided to ""visit"" and get her share of the money once their mom dies, which we obviously refused since their mom is still alive. Within the week, it just so happened that I was there,  and my partner was at work when she barged in and been saying horrible things about me. She told me I was only their for their money (my partner and I have been together for 10 years), she told me horrible things and I didn't expect that she will do that to me. She even went her way to call my dad and told him I am a gold digger (I earn 3x as much as my partner, but she doesn't know) 

Because of that,  my partner decided that everytime somebody visits, I should just hide in the room and pretend I'm not there - since the confrontation traumatized me. A lot. 

Presently,  I know most things have settled. We live together now. His sister is not here but I developed a horrible anxiety every time any of his relative visits. I go into this habit of just hiding in the room and crying.

Yesterday,  his uncle and his wife visited. They're great people but I couldnt shake of the anxiety so I hid. My partner was disappointed because he thought I'm cool with it by now. I'm not,  and I went full breakdown. 

I still feel anxious right now - especially the same house where the confrontation happened before, is the same house we're currently staying now. I admitted to my partner this would never feel like a home because of the whole bad memories I experienced here, and he was disappointed since it's the house he grew up in.

I’ve been going through a really tough time in my life for the past 7 or 8 months and two weeks ago, I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years who is equally as depressed and miserable as me. I did it because I didn’t think she would be able to handle me admitting I need help and blame herself. I thought I’d feel better for doing the right thing and putting less stress on her but now I feel so unbearably lonely and within two weeks she’s already talking to multiple other guys who she is totally obsessed with. I’ve remained friends with her but seeing her on social media and hearing her talk to me about these new boys really hurts. 

On top of this, I am undergoing a lengthy process of having a diagnosis for a suspected brain illness which is significantly impacting my thoughts, memory and eyesight and gives me extremely painful, disorienting headaches every single day which get worse with stress. 

I can’t really get back with my girlfriend because her mum sent me a lengthy text on how I was an awful person and I was unworthy of her anyway and how she had always hated me. I told my family this and they now all despise her and her family. They’re mad that I’m even friends with her. I want to get back with her but I know it’s final and she’s already fallen head over heels for some other guys too.

My stepdad oversteps a lot of boundaries and has a hard time understanding social settings and body language. Because he doesn’t understand boundaries he has a tendency to put me into the middle of their fights and asks me for “advice” so my mom told me to block him on everything and I did but I forgot to block him on Facebook and he has been messaging me about how bad he feels and how he has been educating himself on “how to heal the marriage”. I don’t know if he is just saying this to me so that I can be his advocate to my mom or if he genuinely wants to have a relationship.Anyway I feel like talking to him is betraying my mom in some way because she told me to block him.

Hello I’m 21(M) and single and I don’t know were to put my problem, I’m actually in college studying Engineering. 

I haven’t been looking for a relationship however I found a girl of my same age 21(F) and she is been amazing with me, sadly I’m unable to see her because she studies in another state. 

The problem is not the fact that I’m unable to see her, it’s her weekend behavior, I personally have never liked parties and getting drunk. In fact I have never ever gotten drunk. But she loves to do it, she is usually hanging out in big parties that I personally I’m not a fan of it. 
We are not in a relationship, however the interest of establishing one when I move to her state is more than evident. But with her behavior and tendency of always getting out and getting drunk every Friday and Saturday I just don’t feel good with myself and I don’t see me in 6 months doing that. 

Am I wrong for not liking getting drunk and listen to high volume music? Should I stop texting her?

At the end of year 1 l, we experienced a house fire, to which we lost all physical possessions minus a vehicle. At the beginning of year 2, my family had received a very generous sum of money from anonymous donors to help us rebuild our lives. 

I am compassionate and sometimes overly generous, very few had donated to our roommate after this incident and I felt that as their roommate/friend that I should help replace a few (unnecessary at the time) items of decent monetarily value. I purchased 65"" TV, glass top TV stand, newest Xbox, and game as a gift for them, I still hold the original receipt physically and digitally, almost totalling $1,200.

Fast forward to the beginning of Dec. '21..

Early in December I lost my grandfather, who had raised me like one of his sons from the age 18mo. old, leaving his wife alone. I felt obligated to try and move closer to home so that I could help her with a 20 acre farm and bills. I sat my roommate down shortly after receiving the news and talked about moving around income tax time in '22. We only talked and set no dates except for 'tax time', which as many of you know can take months. 

Fast forward to the middle of January..

My roommate moved out without a notice of any kind. They were gone for two weeks, said nothing about coming back or leaving. When I had asked them if they were going to help pay for rent, I was immediately told that they had already moved out. Leaving 98% possessions in the room they were staying.. I was given no date of when they would come to pick stuff up or clean, only ""I'll be there's"" and not showing up without saying anything.

It's been over 30 days and there's still 60% (my gifts among them, minus the Xbox and game) of their items still in the room, having made one trip only for clothes within the last week. 

I took the liberty of bagging and boxing everything up since I'm the head of the lease. 
I've received no form of payment for 'storage use' of the room and feel that I should keep the remaining gift items I physically purchased as reimbursement for the storage and damages to the walls and carpeting. 
But at the same time they're my friend and I don't want to be that way. 
But at the same time, my family and I feel wronged. I have 3 kids sleeping in one room with 3 beds, I could really use that space and they're robbing me of space and time. 

He even had a car for 2 years with no tags and no license that just got towed away, it seems as if he doesn't care what he loses.

I did not leave on the best terms since I worked at a nursing home and when I was working the Alzheimer's unit, there were no nurses and I was choked by a resident since there was no supervision. I explained to my manager and she told me to suck it up so I quit. 

Now that the context is out of my way, I got a new job very soon at a fast-food chain and have been there for a month. I'm new to the place and struggle occasionally since I have no experience since I was a server at the nursing home and that was my only job as I enjoyed the residents.

He said it was fine but my assistant manager is the one who works on Saturdays. 

One person today told the manager he couldn't come in and the manager did not tell the assistant manager. The assistant manager was mad at both and threatened to write up my co-worker even though imo it's the manager's fault for not communicating. Now I'm stressing I'll get in trouble cause I just texted my assistant manager like an hour ago and he left me on read. I didn't know the manager was not communicative. This is my second job and I'm so worried since in my other job I only had one person to go through and I already feel I'm not liked by my bosses and this is the icing on the cake. To make matters worse for Science National Honor Society, a member complained about me not updating points for a session they tutored a week ago when I update points by-weekly and idk if my advisor and other officers are mad when I've done bi-weekly since September. I'm so anxious everyone will hate me even though I feel it's not my fault and I know I'm going off to college soon anyway but I need all the money I can get till then and I can always go back to the nursing home as concierge since everyone liked me there but this job pays more and I don't want to fuck it up but I don't see how it did and now I can't sleep cause I'm so stressed about  this situation and don't want to cancel on the science fair and look like a flake.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28781,public,self,How to Stop Worrying About Things Out of Control,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/swu5hw/how_to_stop_worrying_about_things_out_of_control/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,

To give some background I am a 22-year-old college senior at a university in Texas studying as a full-time student with 6 classes in total. This attributes to at least 30+ hours of studying, attending classes, and working on projects/papers. I live with my parents at home and have a girlfriend (also 22). She is amazing and super supportive and motivates me when I express how stressed I feel. On top of school I work 25-32 hours a week for one of the biggest supermarket chains in the state of Texas, (you can try to guess which one). I am trying to save up to eventually move out.

Now on top of school and work, I also have projects outside the classroom. I run a mildly successful podcast with my friend from high school. We started in the summer of my freshman year of college and covered topics like movies, entertainment, and music. It is fun and we often have friends on to talk and it's been gaining popularity within the few first years we started it. We have over 80+ episodes released and my partner and I have got a good system going on the production of content. Another project I recently took on this past fall semester was helping a graduate friend of mine, write, storyboard, shoot and edit a short horror film. I impulsively agreed to this as I loved filmmaking since I was a child and wanted to originally major in it but, was unable to due to other reasons. This usually means that sometime each week I must dedicate 4-5+ hours doing calls, texting, planning, or meeting up to film scenes for his film. While this is a project that I am interested in doing, I often find myself needing to put school first as I believe my education is important, and building skills for my career is what should take priority. I want to stop trying to please people and work for myself. I am trying to be more tactful in social situations and decline when most people ask for my help because the truth is I don't owe them anything. I want to stop less doing things for others and more things for me. I feel like I am always being asked for help and not receiving any in return.

  
I have very little time for myself or to go out most weekends and socialize with friends and family or even hop on my Playstation to play games. When I am asked to hang out with close friends I usually respectfully decline.  I miss my friend group and consistently chatting. I try to maintain healthy habits of journaling, going to the gym, and reading but, am never consistent as I am either too busy or tired to pursue my self-interests. But when I do these things it clears my mind and I feel confident in myself. I want to make time to do these things. I feel like one more factor that has also contributed to my stress is my hyper-awareness of my anxieties. I doubt myself a lot and am unsure of most decisions. I get texts that require an immediate response but put them off in fear of sending the wrong response so I don't respond at all. I feel like I am not doing enough for my life and I am constantly behind. I feel like I am constantly stretched thin. I feel burned out. I feel tired most days. I don't want to feel like this. 

What would you do in my situation? Have you ever experienced burnout and if so how did you deal with it? What habits would you recommend to manage stress? I want to try meditating again like I did my freshman year of university. It helped me clear my mind and center myself and I would have streaks lasting weeks or even months. Sorry for the long post but if anyone replies thank you in advance!

tl;dr

I am super stressed and burned out from college, work, managing relationships, and doing multiple projects outside of school that I feel like I am not performing at my best. I want more time to myself and for myself, maybe an established routine.

It's hard to think I'm worthy whatsoever of being in a relationship when I am constantly being reminded that I'm not worthy for anything else, ya know? Plus, the last relationship I was in ended up being a meaningless rebound for the girl to go back to a chain-smoking, burnout dude who is twice our age and already cheated on her many times. Hard to view myself worthy of anything after that one. Probably will take a break for a long time.  
TL;DR - Nothing is going right in life despite boatloads of honest effort on my end. I cannot land a real job.

He just left. What do I do?

(Some background - I’m 20 and moved to uni 4 hours away last September so the lighter can’t be mine, I am a smoker but my parents are not and we have always been super close as a family hence seeking advice )

This morning my Mum called me and she was saying it’s an ‘emergency’, she took a picture of a lighter that she found in her car which my dad was driving for the past couple of days and I said no it’s not mine and so obviously It could only be my dad’s. 
She was asking me to really think and she said this could be the end of a ‘family unit’. 
My dad texted me asking if it’s my lighter however I said I don’t think it is and then I tried to call him but he did not answer. 
My mum finished work and just went home and she called me again whilst they were talking and asked me the same question. I still said no. 
Was this the wrong thing to do, should I have just said it is mine? Then a little bit later I got a text from my mum saying ‘your dad has left’. I have texted my dad and I’ve called him but he won’t answer, I think he’s turned his phone off. My mum sent pictures of what she looks like her on WhatsApp photo - he has both her personal and work number and he is saying that she’s his manager. 
My mum is saying he has probably gone to her.

I don’t know what to do - my mum is distraught and I’m all she has, her family is in another country. And then I’m worried about my dad, he’s not talking to me and I’m worried that something bad is going to happen. 

Do you have any advice? I just feel really lost and like I’ve been pushed into the middle of this because my mum only has me to confide in and this is really not good for her but it’s a lot to deal with and I dont really want to burden my friends with this in case this is all going to be fine.

I've poured my soul out into making sure that I pass this exam, since I failed one earlier this year, but retook it after 2 months of studying. Studying for the make-up test threw me into depression. I haven't done anything that gives me joy in over 6 months because of the make-up test and now this upcoming exam. I've also been bullied by my closest friends during the same period of time, although things seemed to be getting better recently.

The most recent exam was supposed to take place last week, but I decided to delay it by a week in order to attend a meaningful social event. Just 4 days ago, I was ready for the exam and felt like I could do anything. I was ready. I was prepared. I attended the social gathering with high hopes and high expectations. I was not happy, but I was content with my current situation, as it seemed like things were going to get better.

But then, during the social gathering (which lasted around 36 hours), I endured the worst bullying I've ever had to endure. One of my friends decided to start teasing me and bullying me for being allegedly 'gay' (I'm not). For absolutely no reason, he spread a rumor and laughed with my other friends in front of me about how 'gay' I am.  This broke me mentally. I had to spend 36 hours surrounded by the worst human beings I've ever met, and endure the worst humiliation I've ever had to endure in my life.

When I returned home,  I decided to continue studying for the upcoming exam, which is supposed to take place later this week. I sat down and looked at the first practice question I picked out for myself. Nothing. My mind was blank. I was consumed by all the resentment and rage I have towards my friend. I couldn't concentrate. I broke down and had a mental breakdown, where I started throwing things and breaking things out of rage. I decided to go to sleep and continue studying the next day.

That was yesterday. Here I am in front of my computer, studying for the exam, and my mind is still blank. I cannot concentrate as my mind is still full of all the anger I have towards my friend. I had another fit of rage, and shattered my phone out of anger. I have no clue what I'm going to do regarding the test, my social standing, and everything else. I do not want to take the make-up exam, since I want to leave this chapter of my life behind me. All I want is for this test to be behind me, and I don't know if I could handle another month of studying. I have no clue what to do. I have no idea how to study and prepare for the exam.

What should I do? Should I even take the exam this week or automatically wait until the make-up exam? Should I do both?

I have been gritting my teeth all through the years when my Asian culture and family problems came to be. In context summary I have been beaten, mentally/verbally abused, I have had cruel and unusual punishments, etc... My parents are very manipulating as well. Thus my story begins. At the age of 18 or when I graduated high school, I was planning to go to university for college. My parents got me a dog a few days after my graduation party. I was a gullible high school grad who was ecstatic about having my first ever pet and the only pet in my household. I love my dog 'Rose' a beagle labrador mix. Instead of pursuing university, I settled for a commuter college so that I can live at home and be with my dog. I then was in college for nursing, but after my first year of it, I wanted to switch to finance as I loved math and wanted a suit job. This of course did not go well with my parents and they told me I have to go to a private college for nursing. Again at the time, I was not in any way financially able to support myself so I either have to obey or get kicked out. In context to my issues at home. I am treated as a worker in my house from doing carpentry, maintenance, plumbing, electrical work, do this, do that, wake up at 2 am to pick up the mess that wasn't fully cleaned up (parents are germ and super clean freaks to an extreme) and as punishments to not sweeping the floor spotless...I had to eat whatever I didn't clean. I am the oldest of 4 kids and the pride, honor, lead by example has been drilled into my head. I'm getting off-side tract here, but I hope people understand my point here. After a year and a half of the private school, I finally had enough courage to finally tell my parents that I was done. And coming from that Asian household was labeled a disappointment. I then started working full-time in property management and was still under their roof. The punishments just got worse and abuse got worse as well. But I kept it up knowing as the oldest I had to protect my siblings. Soon after working for a while, I came to a realization that the best way was to leave my family to help myself so that later I can help others. So I am moving out this coming Sunday. The biggest issue I am having is my dog. I know that my parents will kill my dog if I leave it home. I love my dog, but I know it's going to restrict me financially and take up my time. I know that this dog is a liability for me as I am moving out but also will be going back to college fall of 2022. I won't have time to take care of my dog. I know that I can be successful if I do not have the burden of my pet. But my dog is my best friend and a child to me. I know I will regret it either way of giving her up for adoption or keeping her in holding back my future success. I don't know what to do......To struggle financially and time or give away my own child that I have raised as a puppy. I feel so bad knowing that either decision I make is a bad choice. I feel bad knowing my dog is not at fault. I feel terrible having to write this up. But I need people's thoughts on this before finally making the big decision.

My school bully threatened me with a knife.
How do you deal with severe bullying?
Im 13 but when I say severe, it’s not just severe from my eyes, it’s SEVERE. (I’ll stop saying “severe now, I think you got my point). I’m in Canada which is supposed to be a country full of nice people, right? Well, not where I live. You could say I live in the “ghetto” since there’s a lot of crime around here, but I wouldn’t call it that. Now let’s get to the point:
I go to a grade 7-12 school which, surprisingly to some people, actually does exist in Canada. But there’s this group of grade 12s that pick on students really badly. Especially my friend group. 
Now usually, I would just tell myself “only 4 more months of school and they’re gonna be gone” but apparently due to some rumours that the guidance council then confirmed, they’re taking a “victory lap”.
(For some people who don’t know, that means they’re going to be in high school for an extra year, yeah ik, FUCK).
Now they do the usual stuff like shoving students into lockers )I was stuck in one for 45 minutes before a student found me, then another 30 minutes for the janitor to figure out whose locker it was, so they could get that person to open it, then another 20 minutes for the person to agree to open the locker, that’s 1 hour 35 minutes, if you, just like me, don’t like doing math).
But if you think that shoving a student into a locker is all they do and that I’m just being dramatic, just keep reading…
Yesterday, they threatened my friend group with a knife to give them our lunch money (just like how the movies go, since our high school is literally like the bully movies rather than high school musical which is annoying but more preferred imo). They threatened us at the back of the school since the cafe isn’t safe since they basically RULE the place and based off “random selection” beat up some kid into giving them their lunch money and for some reason, this “random selection” is always my friend group.
Oh and btw, the school staff and lunch room supervisors have all given up, since one of them got a black eye stopping a fight last year and quit his job. 
So since we were tired of getting “randomly selected” to give up our lunch money, we decided to go to the isolated back of the school to avoid getting “mugged” by their friend group like we do in the halls and even the washroom.
And basically, the bullies friend group assumed we were escaping school to hide in a nearby plaza to buy our food, since we had just leaved the corridors to get outside and they caught us before we set our lunch down so they must’ve thought we were planning on going further.
And since for some reason everyone sees me as the leader of the “nerd squad” (there actually is a reason, I’ll mention it at the bottom to read optionally), their leader dude pinned me to a wall and pulled out a knife and said that if I “tried to pull shit like this again”, he would “see what his cool new knife can do”.
See? I wasn’t exaggerating. And this just happened earlier today so I’m still shitting myself, and honestly, we’re the brokest kids at the school so no wonder we’re always chosen for “random selection”, since it’s so fun for them to watch the sensitive one in our friend group cry over how their parents can barely pay the bills.
In fact, that’s the reason why we’re chosen for “random selection”ever time, because at some point, they were actually randomly selecting kids to pick on, but when they picked on my friend, he started crying over how his family can’t afford the bills (this was last year) and ever since, they thought it would be so amusing to steal our friend group’s money.
This is why I’m the “leader of the nerd squad”:
Basically there was this situation about the “leader of the bullies” picking on our elderly lunch supervisor and my friends (who weren’t my friends at the time, but they were friends with each other since I was still new to the school) decided to stand up for her, and I was bystanding along with like 20 other kids.
Anyway, since they were a friend group but were also new to the school (they spent elementary school together) they didn’t know that the bully dude wasn’t supposed to be messed with, and to be fair, neither did I.
But for some reason, when the bully dude got mad, and everyone tried to avoid “looking into his eyes since he might kill you”, except I didn’t know much about him so I just stood there locking eye contact and keeping my chin up. That was until he pointed at me and said “you” and that’s when I got really nervous and he said some things then beat me up, what an amazing first day of high school, am I right? And technically, in America and some other places, that would be the first day of middle school, but that doesn’t really matter.
Later, the kids who got me into that fight by accident apologised for it and we became friends later on and got picked on for the remainder of grade seven.
And just in case you didnt understand the timeline, first, my friend (who wasn’t my friend yet) cried over how broke he was in the lunch room after getting mugged off random selection, and his friends starting standing up for him and the bully still got his money and gave him a “warning”. 
However, I wasn’t there when that happened, they explained in the gc but we now realise that they should’ve listened to that warning since when they defended that elderly lunch supervisor later in the day, the bully was not having it and that shit was what got me beaten up and known as the “leader” of our “loser” friend group. I also got a black eye, LOTS of bruises and my nose would bleed random times during the day.
Additional reading for more explanation: And he’s been doing this to ALL the students (he randomly pushes kids in the halls onto the floor then they all hang up and start kicking the kid, it’s a daily occurrence and it’s mostly the grade 7s, 8s and 9s) so it’s not just my friend group, mostly us though.
He even took my phone and told me he’d destroy it if I didn’t have “HIS money” the next time I see him (I don’t owe him anything). That happened because I thought that if I just didn’t bring lunch money, he’d leave me alone since he can’t get anything out of me. Nope, I was wrong. He took my phone and even though I brought him money the next day , he gave me my phone back with my phone screen SHATTERED. My mom killed me because I couldn’t tell her that he did it because she’d go try to talk to his parents (his mom is dead and his dads an abusive alcoholic, as rumours say, but it’s been confirmed that his mom is actually dead) so all that would do is get him even more mad at me.
And we can’t go to the guidance council because the school bows what’s happening all the guidance council says is “have you tried telling him to stop?”. Not surprised tbh because if the school wanted to do something they would. 
And the cops can’t do anything either…let me rephrase that, they won’t do anything either. Because the bully’s dad is a whole cop and he won’t do anything, he just chills around the school to make sure no ones gonna try to murder someone or just stop random people deciding to beat up a kid, usually someone from the “bully squad” decides they get bored and decide to pick on a kid by beating them up and throwing their backpack in the garbage. “Swirlies” are also a common occurrence around here.
In conclusion, I go to a very shitty school and idk what to do abt it rather than just accept my fate as I can still remain living as long as I have $7 a day to give to the bully so he doesn’t skin me alive :). I also leave home without breakfast, lose my lunch money so bye bye lunch and dinner doesn’t happen much around since everyone around here is broke.

 I’ve been best friends with a couple guys since junior high school. We hung out all the time for years until I was about 25. I just turned 26 and since the last year things have dramatically changed for me and my mindset and I’m really starting to think about life seriously. Approaching 30 is scaring me. I got myself out of an 3 year opiate addiction and have really been trying to get ahead by working hard.

For a little more context, ever since we’ve been growing up we all had a dream of being wealthy. We were obsessed with doing it. But as I think about life I start to realize that for most of my friends this was probably all talk. My one best friend only currently has a job because of and through me and I got him a government job. The friend that I got this job is now selling fentanyl on the side because he wants more money because he is falling behind on bills after spending it stupidly. ($10,000 diamond necklace) My other friend quit his job and just sits around watches south park all day. 

My problem is I seem to be all alone. My friends don’t have any motivation or work ethic, they just want to hang out all day and smoke weed.

My issue is these are truly my only friends and because I’ve been trying to get on the right path I see them less and less and I am seeing us fall out. I spend my typical day at my 7-3 day job, I started a graphic design business that’s been treating my nicely with the pay, I study and learn about financial markets / investing daily and I am trying to start 2 more businesses, an Airbnb management company and a digital marketing company for local businesses near me. 

My friends complain about life and money but when I bring up my ideas for businesses and how we could make money, it’s like pulling teeth, their response to me just seems to me like their attitude is “it’s too hard why even bother trying” so they just take the easy way out, like selling drugs. They don’t ever bring it up to me and it seems like they want me to just build it all alone and then they’ll join for pay.  

I genuinely don’t want to be around these type of people and I want to work hard to try my best to succeed at my goals. Is it worth to keep these people in my life for my social mental health or are they just holding me down and I’m better off by myself?

Hi Elliot, fyi this is gonna be a long story but really want ur response, this could be the end of humanity! Name is (unknown) and I have no idea what I want to do with my life, really lost…Ever since I was 13 I always wanted to become a YouTuber, like making it into a career… My goal in life was to having all my friends living together, hangout and playing video games like there’s no tomorrow, just living life to the fullest “TOGETHER”! That was such a vibe I wanted so so so bad!! So, I started off with a gaming channel tryna convince my friends onto doing YouTube video with me. I hoping they would wanna do this as a career for themselves, but they weren’t honestly never on and wasn’t a big gamer like me, so moved on to becoming a streamer at the age of 18. But sooner than later, I realized I lack confidence and was really terrible at reading… A this moment I felt like giving up in life. I was ready to follow my mom’s footsteps, onto working a job that wasn’t gonna make me feel happy about myself. Then at age of 20 I started a Vlog channel with couple of my friends and honestly it went great, but thing started to turn south very soon. My friends started breaking apart cuz of drama and other BS I really don’t care about, but do cuz there my friends… It’s now February 18th 2022 and I’m 22 years old with just a vlog channel and no friends (Not in that way) But more like we don’t have the same goal anymore… I just feel like everyone is growing up and having different opinions on life… I honestly still wanna do YouTube, but just don’t know how to go about it, your video honestly gives me hope. I love how u edit your videos, into a montage of your life, such a great art! Kelly Luke and you editing skills are A one!! I love how u guys are all together and living like a big family, truly living my dream goal! Not tryna sound like a bitch but I truly feel like I’m alone. I truly believe if I had a group of friends that’s had the same motives like me or similar my life would be great!! But then again idk if that’s what I need in life… so my question to you is, what should I do?",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28759,public,self,Let go my 13 year old dream goal!

I've been looking at apartments in the notoriously expensive california and I found a 1 bed studio apartment for 1350 a month, and it's 6 minutes away from the gracie jiu jitsu headquarters (somewhere I would love to train at), so it can't be like a terrible neighborhood.

Since HS I have always been in the mindset of studying/working.

It then made me realize that I may not want to pursue this field anymore which made me get a full-time job at a well known company.

Or ""There has to be more to my life than working at a full-time job"". Keep in mind also there are alot of personal things in my life going on in the background where it put me in the mindset of doing things alone for now. I had a couple of REALLY bad relationships in my time where I decided that I wanted to focus on myself. Because of how much time I've had to think I decided to pursue additional opportunities such as studying a new field.

My boss said he doesn’t remember what was promised to me on Zoom, but he reviewed his little notebook and said according to his notes, today’s payday is accurate. He said I probably remembered wrong. 

Should I ask his boss, the one who actually facilitated the call, on Monday about it? The chances for me being wrong are 50/50. If I’m wrong, worst case scenario is my boss and his boss will just laugh at me for thinking I got that salary. If I’m right, I get the higher salary.

I (early twenties male) am coming into a windfall of about 100k.  
This is a life-changing opportunity and I want to treat it as such, which is why I am here. 

My goal is long-term I want to set myself for the future and not increase my current quality of life. I am in college still and will be for the next few years. But I am not sure what is the best approach as there is so much information out there.

I should mention that I am currently renting and am also currently getting financial help from the government(Fasfa) for taking classes, it is not much but it helps.

With the research I have done I am thinking my approach will be to put the money into an account so that it does not show up as income allowing me to continue to get Fasfa aid. I have already told myself I will not touch this money until after college. Once after college, I plan to use the money to make a down payment on a house. Although I can cross that bridge when I get there in a few years.

Given this is the correct approach, what is the type of investment vehicle I should put the money in while in college.

I’ve been working full time for about 10 years now as a concrete worker, I work for my father and basically worked my way up from the bottom as a tool cleaner, to being his second jn charge and main concrete finisher. Now he’s in his 50s and he is totally ruined from this job in pain and wishing he could retire already but he can’t. The older I’ve grown I’ve noticed how much he really doesn’t love the job anymore but he’s stuck with it now til he retires and it’s a struggle. Basically I’m 27 and I’ve built myself up in my trade to be pretty well self sufficient but seeing how my dad is, I don’t think I want to go down that path! I’ve already started losing interest in the job now and after having a 4 week break over Christmas last year, coming back to work this year I really am losing interest. I’m just not sure what to do, I don’t mind decorative concrete work (like driveways and footpaths and stencilled finishes and what not) but over the years I’ve discovered a love for gardening and plants. I just don’t know whether I should pursue a totally new career involving that, continue trying different aspects of the trade I’m in, or ideally mesh the 2 together so I can use my skills to get myself into a garden/landscape career path? Sorry for the long question, I’m just really stuck for what to do!

TLDR; I don’t wanna grow old and ruin my body doing the job I’m in (concreting) but don’t know how to switch into something I’m more interested in (gardening/landscaping) or how to somehow mesh my old skills as a pathways to a new career.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28741,public,self,Career advice needed,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/svacwm/career_advice_needed/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,

Since we’ve been broke up I’ve never seen any cold sores or anything that would resemble a genital outbreak I once saw one really hard bump that didn’t really have any sensation or feel to it but apparently that’s not herpes even though I’ve heard of people having just one sore. I did get tested one month after we broke up and both the igg and IgM was negative. I don’t know how important it is to get tested for this again….Doctors don’t even recommend testing for herpes and I don’t know how I would handle learning I have something that I have no physical evidence of seeing.

Learning into code and going into IT is really attractive for the money, but it is a big time investment.  
Going into an entry-level position has a higher chance of being stuck in a dead-end job, but I'll at least earn a solid wage immediately.

I could also pick up a part time job and learn to code with my extra time. But my motivation would have to be quite high.

I want to point out a few background details that I think are relevant when looking at the situation. My BFF — let’s call her Maude — has never been in a relationship; she kissed two guys in college, lost her virginity casually after college &amp; has only slept with one other person (aka the guy who she is involved with in the love triangle now). Maude is very insecure &amp; has a lot of unpacked childhood trauma that she has not addressed but she does a fairly good job at masking this. I do not live in the same city as Maude but we see each other pretty often. I will refer to the engaged-lover-boy as Oliver &amp; his fiancé as Victoria. Both Maude &amp; Victoria work in the same industry and their professional lives, as well as social lives, crossover immensely. When I met Oliver, her was planning to purchase Victoria’s engagement ring the following day. I subtly let him know that I did not approve of what he was doing to my best friend and his soon-to-be fiancé. He was definitely receptive of my stern tone and I could tell he was intimidated by me, but proceeded to flirt very obnoxiously with my best friend in front of a group of their friends as if he wanted to get under my skin/assert his “I do what I want” attitude. The day before Oliver proposed to Victoria, he manipulated his way into sleeping with Maude. After he proposed to Victoria, they had an impromptu engagement party that my BFF attended… when she arrived, he whispered to her ”I know this must be really difficult for you.” (barf!) It has been months since the engagement and the affair is still happening. On top of that, Victoria has mad a huge effort to become closer friends with Maude. A few weeks ago, Victoria received a suspicious anonymous message essentially warning her not to marry Oliver because he is a liar. AND! Of the one of the first people that she confided this information with happened to be Maude (soooooo so so cringe/anxiety inducing). Maude has been in a total panic since, understandably. I knew that this was going to blow up somehow and I fear my predictions for worst case scenario are a high possibility. 

I am so worried about Maude. I know that this will affect her internally but also professionally, in her friendships, and in future intimate relationships. I want to support her and to be a good friend but I definitely do not condone this situation on a moral level. I’ve thought of all the ways this could play out and am not hopeful for it to end well for any parties involved. I’ve tried in so many ways to encourage Maude to get professional help from a therapist or something along those lines… and for her to figure out how to get out of this situation but she is not interested in speaking with a professional. 

I am leaving tomorrow to visit Maude for her birthday weekend and am 99% certain I will run into Victoria &amp; Oliver during my stay. I’ve been fretting over this interaction because I am not the best person at playing it cool when something is bothering me deep down.

A bit of backstory:

I have always been THE art kid. No matter what kind of career I was interested in people would tell me to ""not waste my potential"" and go the art route. After school I joined a 2 year graphic design course and already felt myself not really enjoying it. Still I graduated doing something I enjoyed. 
I illustrated a book.

I started studying Multimediadesign right after school thinking this would be MY thing since I was incredibly interested in animation and interactive media. The first year everything was fun fine and dandy.

For the record , I am neurodivergent, had a shite childhood and struggled with gender identity so my ""formative years"" and the process of finding myself were not finished...not at all.

Simultanously to my studies I was fortunate enough to start my transition from female to male.
...

Five years down the line.

I started therapy and am working through trauma. I am engaged to my absolutely loving, gentle and supportive boyfriend. I have worked as a designer for a year and have finished several projects in multimedia design. None of which I really enjoyed apart from those I was able to illustrate in.

I am five years into my transition and just start to turn into who I am. I am starting to love my body and my identity.

But during those five years I lost all passion for design and art. Infact I hate the thought of working as a designer again. The constant pressure of being creative, the competition, the requirements. I am burnt out. I hate every waking minute. All I really want to do, and still wanna do is illustrate. But for myself.yet I ignored my own red flags and pushed through. The pandemic only made it worse. At least I realized that I enjoy illustration the most.

Last year started working in an animal welfare center and the work is beyond refreshing. I LOVE every minute of it though I am only volunteering in the administrative office. I come home and feel creative. As soon as I think about having to design for work..I feel depressed. 

I had my ninth panic attack this week.
I need to make a decision.

And that decision included getting a ""regular job"" at a cafe and slowly starting to built my freelance career. Still I feel like I am throwing away my degree and education. In the end..all I wanna be os happy and designing fulltime makes me severely unhappy....and I wanna feel love for art again.

Yet I feel like I have failed my mum eho has supported me, I have failed my hubby who has supported me...But I am so..so unhappy.

But I’m more worried about the cost , and complicated stuff like can I die from it? Will it affect anything in the future or am I doing something completely stupid and because I’m so young it will effect me mentally or emotionally

So a while ago I started dating this girl, for story sake her name is Kate (not in real life) and things are going great for the most part, but after a few months of dating we took out the romance and just went to being friends for some complicated reasons I won’t get into as they are really personal and irrelevant to the story. Around this time I also started to develop what I think is depression (I haven’t been diagnosed, mostly due to the fact I can’t afford to talk to a therapist or doctor right now, but it’s my best guess. I plan on talking to someone about it once I have the cash) and decided I needed a fresh start because the area I lived was just not working for me. 
So I used all my savings and moved to the US to live with my grandparents, and things are going okay, but me and Kate are still in contact and what I think is depression followed me and hit me hard some nights and because she was essentially my only friend, she was always in the way of that, and I always hated myself for it. We would fight a lot and once I calmed down, I would remember that we fought and I instantly felt terrible, but we would usually make up, sometimes it would take longer then other times. 
When we were dating I had this internet friend who for story’s sake is named Zoe, we started as just chill internet friends, sending memes, playing minecraft, she also lived in Europe, where I was in a different continent but somehow she fell in love with me and called us soulmates, she even messaged my mom calling her a bitch because she wouldn’t let me drop out of high school to go live with her. She was also tagging me in those Facebook posts that said “do you know your soul mate” and I would tell her that we aren’t, I didn’t tell her about Kate though, but Kate saw the messages from her, and I tried to explain that I wasn’t interested in someone I’ve never met, but then Zoe messaged my mom and that was that, I blocked her on everything and that was the end of it, or so I thought. I told Kate what happened and she said okay, and we went about our days, I broke it off about a month or two later. 
Cut to last night, I am talking to Kate, getting ready for bed and somehow Zoe came up and Kate said that I was “entertaining her” and when I asked her what she meant she just went on that ii led her on while we were together and I should never have been friends with Zoe. I tried defending myself, I mentioned that me and Zoe were friends before we started dating, and I had no idea that she would have acted the way she did. For context I have always had trouble making friends, Zoe was essentially my only close friend till Kate, and then when I moved she was literally my only friend. But anyway, I stay up till 3am trying to find out where Kate is coming from and why she is so upset about this now and the whole time I just start feeling worse and worse about myself. Finally I snapped, I sent her one last fuck you and blocked her, then I started crying, not like little tears, like full on sobbing like a child. I stay up pacing my room for another hour just crying, trying to calm myself down, then I decided to go for a walk, as I am getting ready I saw my knife that my grandfather gave me, I take it, but this time I felt like I would want to use it on myself instead of for self defence like I usually take it for. I start walking, still feeling like shit, I had mostly stopped crying but I was still a big mixture of sad and angry, I was sad that I had just lost essentially my last friendship but angry that Kate basically called me a cheater. My walk was not short, almost 3 hours and took me till like 7am and when I got home I just crashed and woke up at 4pm. I started writing this about ab hour after I woke up, I don’t feel as angry anymore, it’s all just directed at myself because I know I could have handled it better and I feel really sad that I essentially lost my last friend.

I (28f) have just gone through a messy breakup with a guy (30m) I was with for 8 years (and engaged for 2). We moved to this town together and after financially helping him through school (splitting all bills, helping make life easier etc) i now I find myself single &amp; in an expensive house. 
I currently live by myself &amp; am making the bills by picking up an overtime shift every now &amp; then. Im want to go back to school to pursue nursing. I know this would take a lot of time, most likely not allowing me to work full time, much less pick up shifts. 
My question is, should I stay where I am &amp; learn to work around it (maybe find a roommate, take out a loan? See about tuition reimbursement at the hospital?) And be with my friends / the activities I like doing, (i also have a good reputation at a hospital i really like).

Clean/feed her birds and small animals cages. Whenever there's a mess she calls out for my name and when I don't make it in time because I was busy or in the shower she gets upset. Aside from this her personality doesn't help, she likes to joke a lot and saying it once isn't enough. She also likes to joke that she can kick me out as a response when I have slight attitude or playfully make a joke. I've tried enjoying her company but she makes me want to kill myself or slam my head against a wall. I want to move out but currently work at least 20 hours a week and unfortunately don't have much experience in life to feel assured of myself that I'll be able to provide a stable home for my partner without worry.

I have now been working for six months, and i truly feel no passion towards my current job. Its kind of in the realm of what i studied for - but its mostly a sales job where i get measured in how much i sell, and how many active customers i have in my pipeline etc.   
This just doesn't work for me. I just feel like an imposter because i usually do well at the things i put my mind to, but this sales thing just makes me feel horrible since my lack of motivation is reflecting my bad performance in measured sales.   


I wish i could quit my job and do something else but that would look really bad on my resume, so i feel like i have to be here at 2 years before i can change jobs. In Norway it is really hard to get a good job without at least 2 years of work experience, because almost everyone has a higher education. I am really passionate about almost everything i do in life, so that makes it feel so much worse when i just cant stand my first job.

I always did well in school, I played baseball, got good grades and had big aspirations, but somewhere along the way I began struggling with depression and anxiety. Going into college as a freshman in 2020 I struggled with online school and keeping myself on track. This caused my depression to grow and I eventually quit school, and lost all of my friends in the process. To become productive again I worked full time for over a year, and was in line to start a new job which eventually fell through. Today I'm in the process of finding a new job, which hasn't been successful so far. Some days I wake up motivated to succeed in this life, but most days I question if anything will ever feel motivating or inspiring. I'm incredibly grateful that I have a roof to live under and a family, but my hopes and aspirations aren't there anymore. While I could see myself going back to school, I have absolutely no idea what I want to get out of this life or what sort of career could fulfill me. I feel completely exiled from my peers, and the my relationship with family has become extremely toxic. I've spent time programming and learning various skills in my free time, but nothing I do seems to spark any sort of motivation in me. I despise feeling this way and I feel guilty for complaining so much when I've been given so much opportunity, but I can't help the emptiness I feel. Nothing that I can possibly think of in my future gives me the desire to give life my all. It's not that I'm afraid or I feel like I'm inadequate, I just feel incredibly depressed and hopeless about life in general. I don't want to spend a life worrying about politics and my income and what people are obsessing over online or anything superficial. None of that feels important to me. Although I can't say what really does feel important anymore.

If you've read so far, I'd just like to ask; for anyone who has ever struggled with life or what they want to do someday, what helped you find that answer? How do I get out of this hole I feel as if I'm lost in? If there was a step by step guide on how to succeed in life I'd be glad to follow it. I've learned from my mistakes but it just feels like it's too late now. My life just feels like a bunch of wasted opportunity, and dead end dreams. And honestly, I despise the idea of being chained to a 9-5 like I am at the moment, gradually perspiring only to go on doing something I despise doing. I know I can't continue on the path I'm on now so please somebody offer me any advice. 

I never intended on spewing these thoughts online but I can't take it anymore. I can't take another day mulling around aimlessly until it's time to go to sleep again. I just want to do something spectacular with my life. As I said I've learned from my mistakes and I'd do anything just to find what I want in life, but nothing I pursue seems to be for me.

I have this friend who struggles with a lot of mental issues, and they are living far away. They say they are taking some time off and need some space, which I totally respect. But now I have reasons to think that they are taking some time off of *me* specifically.

We were so close and I really never shared the level of intimacy I shared with them with anyone else. It breaks my heart that I'm not enough. I try to be there and make sure they know I'm present while respecting their space, but now I just feel plainly rejected.

I was thinking about ""breaking up"" with them, saying that I feel like I'm doing more harm than good at this point. Which is the truth. I wanna say that I'll stop making myself so present, and that if they want to, they know where to find me.

We have been together for 11 years and it’s been a very rocky relationship to say the least, the biggest problem we have is his mental health and anger issues. He’s turning 30 this week and he has always jokingly said “I’m going to kill myself when I turn 30 if I don’t have my shit together” but he said it in a very serious tone recently and I’m so scared and terrified. 


I hesitate to take legal or medical action because of his career , it can be ruined if this “gets out” he is an armed security guard and they cannot have ANY current mental health issues at all or he can loose his right to having a gun, he carries one everyday at work, He is a high school drop out so this is the only good thing he has going for him, he needs this career to get good money otherwise he has no other trade so keep that in mind, he has bills and rent he also supports his mother financially it’s ALOT of pressure to work here. He used to be on ssi for his “ schizophrenia” that is a monthly check given to him from the government because he was unable to work due to mental illness (his mother told him to lie about hearing voices as a child to get that check since he was 16 she’s never worked his dad is a drug addict) 


when he was 21 we both agreed that the ssi check isn’t enough and it’s enabling him to not grow and move up in life and that his mom would have to find another way to support herself, she didn’t want him to work because then they would take the help away but he was ready to be “normal” and work and be like everyone else. He proved to the doctor that he was mentally okay and he got mentally examined and they determined that there was no sign of schizophrenia, they pronounced him as “medically cured” and stoped his ssi he was now able to work. due to all that he hadn’t worked an actual job like most until about 8/7 years ago but even then it was inconsistent and paid minimums wage.







With all that being said, as you can see he feels so behind in life he feels like a failure, he doesn’t see a way out of poverty and he has become extremely negative and mean and takes out his anger on me. Due to his lack of money he has never been able to get me a Christmas gift birthday gift Valentine’s Day gift which I have been very understanding about. But now that he has a job there is no excuse, I let him know that I was upset that he didn’t give any effort into this relationship. He then told me that he thought we should break up because I ask for way too much, he told me that he didn’t love me and that he was just used to me. I told him that I couldn’t be upset for how he felt, that if he did not want to be with me he does not have to I will never force anyone to be with me. I’m guessing that’s not the response he expected and he immediately took back everything he said, he said that he was just angry and he felt angry that I made him feel bad for not getting me anything, I said that could’ve easily been avoided by him being considerate and thoughtful and gotten me something anything even if it’s one dollar. 

I am extremely upset and depressed because I’m so confused, does he want me or not, did he mean those words or not? If someone doesn’t want me that’s fine but playing with my emotions isn’t okay and I love him so much it’s very hard idk what is real or what is not. He told me that the only reason why he lashed out was because he’s extremely depressed and sad and he doesn’t wanna live anymore he said he wakes up every single day hating his life. And I mean bringing up the Valentine’s Day gift just made him feel like a shittyr person which is why he said we should just break up. 



He apologized and said that he loves me more than anything he said sorry, I told him that he’s experiencing depression and that this is normal, but if he really feels like he can hurt himself we need to get him help even if cost him his job, he said he promised he wouldn’t do anything he was just having a very very bad week. I’m lost I’m scared I’m heartbroken I don’t know what to do I don’t know what to think I don’t know anything 😔❤️ 


If I stay he could continue being mean and rude and disrespectful towards me. If I leave I’m scared you’ll do something to himself and I can’t live with that.

Knew I would go to college, even considered going for a PhD at one point. Went to university in Europe for 2 years, got good grades, but didn't mesh with uni culture and _hated_ sitting at my desk for hours on end reading. I wanted to work doing something practical, so I left.

Moved back home, worked in construction, WWOOFed, worked at a grain site; then as a dishwasher at a restaurant, then at a desk job (hated that one), then as a baker (my longest-held job!). I loved the feeling of feeding people, being knowledgeable about a specialized trade, and the early hours. Not super fast-paced, and definitely a job that uses brainpower. However, my workplace was not the best, neither was the pay, and I thought maybe there isn't a future in this after all. So I went back to school for the piece of paper.

Enrolled in a big state university, only needed 1.5 or 2 years to graduate. Dabbled in science but went back to humanities. I'm in my second semester there now and... I feel like I don't want to go any longer. It's just so much work that I don't feel adapted to, and I keep thinking that after this, it's most likely just more of the same: sitting at a computer typing emails and shit. More and more I feel like the academic work I do means nothing, and I just want to go back to being a baker or work on a farm lol.

I have to finish this semester or I will be on the hook for my grants. But after that, would it be silly to leave with a year left? I don't want to waste more time and money here, I just want to get on with my life.

I got my first job out of college as a designer/illustrator. I only worked there for one year when my roommate and I had a falling out, while that was happening we got laid off (we worked at the same place and the company went under) and she skipped town right before the lease was up.

With no job, no roommate, and my lease renewal coming up I ended up moving back in with my parents. The next six months was a downward spiral of my failing mental health, suddenly needing to help care for 3 young children and a failed attempt at freelancing. I was just starting to get interviews when covid hit and my life just totally stalled.

Pre-omnicron, when things started opening back up I was applying again and getting some interviews but no offers. An opportunity at a bank as a teller/loan officer came my way through a mutual friend. I agonized over taking the position because I didn't want to get stuck there and felt like I was giving up but ultimately I was convinced to take it because at least it was SOMETHING and it was full time with benefits.

Well now we're in month 7, I'm still stuck at the bank job and I'm really starting to despise it. I don't really mind the actual process of it all, but I can't take the fucking goals. The goals put on us are unrealistic and no matter how well we perform our system is set up so there's no way to personally affect how much you do in loans and yet that's how our personal performance is measured. Even though our manager has pretty much outright said she agrees that is unreasonable she still gets passive aggressive and blames us when the end of month goals aren't getting met but then had no feedback or suggestions on how to improve.

Maybe that's normal in sales but I'm just not cut out for it, I can't take the frustration and stress of being berated and told I'm under performing for an aspect of my job I don't have any direct control over.

So I'm miserable at the bank, I want to get out of here so bad but I still can't find a job to get back into my field. I'm losing hope. I had such a great start to my career but now I'm 4, going on 5 years out of school and I've only had one years of actual work experience in my field. I feel out of touch and rusty, everything in my portfolio is way out of date but I've lost all confidence in my abilities and I don't know how to fix it. I don't think I can go back to school and pile more debt on top of the student loans I've only barely started to make a dent in.

Im not in any relationship so it's just me and I can't afford rent at $16/h by myself in my area even though I'm full time. I'm relying on the good graces of my parents and I don't think they'd tolerate it if I quit and even then I still need a new job.

Photography is where my heart lies even though it is near impossible for me (at the moment) to make a living off of it. I did manage to find a small studio to work at in the meantime, but with this job there is no room to grow and it isn’t a job I’d want long term. 

When I finished college I was considering going into the military as a photographer and I’ve applied, which was a year ago. Im still waiting for the offer letter, if any. That being said, I’ve also started thinking of going back to college for graphic design, a 3 year program. 

I’ve now found myself in a huge predicament for a number of reasons. The military is obviously a very different lifestyle, but as an imagery tech it would be very satisfying since my passion is photography. Not to mention the job security that comes with that job and the pay is impossible to find as a photographer outside of the military. On the other hand, graphic design and photography go together and I’d be an asset knowing both. I’m also in a position in my life where I can afford to go back to school, and I am still very young with lots of time ahead of me. 

I’m unsure if I should throw away one year worth of tedious application to the military if I know I’d want to eventually join, and I’m more likely to be accepted right out of college and as young as I am. If I do join now and love the job I’d lose out on gaining more education, because you can’t really just leave the military or do part time and come back.

There is no TLDR, this will be a long read.

I don't know the best way to approach explaining, so I'll just start from the beginning. Hopefully, the relevance of the historical events will become obvious later. 

When I was 15, I met a girl and I fell in love with her. A few months later I got my heartbroken. I was pretty devastated for several years.

When I was 17, I met my future wife ( henceforth referred to as W). She just came to the US at the age of 16 by herself to live with her older brother who I knew. I took classes in Spanish so since she spoke no English I was able to chat with her.  Eventually, she invited me to a party that her brother was throwing. Some events happened that resulted in her older brother being arrested and spending almost 10 years in prison, I'm not being specific for anonymity sake.

This is the older brother she lived with, so she literally had been in the US for about a year and spoke very little English and the only person she knew that she could communicate with was me. Keep in mind before the night of the party we had talked for a few hours at most, and now here we are and I'm the only person she has. I soon learned she absolutely could not return back to home, I wouldn't wish her previous living situation on my worst enemy.

We end up living together for a few months, at some point becoming intimate and then we decided to get married so we could get her green card. (oh boy how naive we were) 

About 3 years after we got married, she got pregnant. Through the next 10+ years of marriage we had our ups and downs. Over the years there were plenty of times I wanted to leave but if I did she'd never get her green card.  So I stayed because I could not put someone I loved deeply in that type of situation.  Remember going back to her previous living conditions is not something I would wish on anyone. 

After about 16 years of marriage she finally got her green card. (yes, it took that long....).

Fast forward a few years and here we are. I love her but honestly most of the time I absolutely can't stand to be around her, she is literally a combination of all of my pet peeves in one person. One of the biggest things is clinginess. She wants to constantly be near me or talking to me. I am a serious introvert, I need alone time more than time with others.  She also loves to talk about how she wants us to grow old together and I do my best to change the conversation.  She also does this helpless thing where if I am around she can't seem to do anything or even speak English. By herself she can magically do it all. 

Lately I think I've just been feeling resentful.  I was watching this sitcom and there was some romantic drama and it made me realize that I really want to feel that ""honeymoon"" phase feeling again, I've only ever felt it once and that was 20 some years ago with my first and only girlfriend. Ive also never lived alone, I went straight from living with my parents to living with her and the thing is it is not an exaggeration to say I'd be content in my home all by myself for 95 percent of the time. I'm married to a very clingy woman, so realistically I have to be strategic to get as much alone time as I can.  She also suffers from pretty severe depression and PTSD.  I suffer from relatively mild depression by comparison. But the longer I'm with her the more stressed and depressed I become.

How do I split with my wife amicably? I feel like if we split on any terms besides amicably that it will lead to many issues both financial but worse would be her mental health. She's the mother of my son and we've been together for most of our lives at this point, I feel this absolute dread to think she would suffer.

Am I just stuck in a pipe dream when I think about actually dating other people and having that awesome honeymoon phase that I felt when I was with my first girlfriend? Is that real or just some teenage movie thing? 

Our sex life is I'd say above average but I've only ever been with her and an FWB before her. I would like to experience sex with other women.  I don't have a specific person in mind, just someone different. My wife would say this has to do with her weight or stretch marks or some other shit but realistically that shit doesn't effect her level of attractiveness to me at all.

Literally, I can't. I wish I was over exaggerating. Nothing I like makes me feel excited anymore. LIstening to ASMR comforting videos doesn't even make me feel anything. Nothing. No words make me feel a little better anymore, nothing does. Just a deafening silence in my head that never ends.

I'm not suicidal, I could never do that to my family. I wouldn't even be able to work up the courage if I tried. But I do think about it every single day.

If I die, nobody outside of my immediate family would probably care that much. They barely understand me as it is anyway. In my last relationship, my girlfriend would beat over my head with how worthless I am. How I'll never make it anywhere in the world, or I'll never be enough. One day, she stayed on a call from sunset to sunrise telling me how much of a worthless piece of shit I am. Yet I stayed on the phone the whole time, because I cared for what she had I say. Sometimes I miss her, she was the only person to ever give me some sort of affection. However, with each passing day I believe what she said more and more. It's come to the point where I naturally see that as truth. I don't think anyone can tell me otherwise anymore. Not that I'd ever meet someone someday that actually cares about me. I'm a worthless piece of shit. I wouldn't be good enough for them. I'd come with way too much baggage at this point to be worth saving. People shouldn't waste their time on me.

If anyone actually reads this and says ""get help"", I tried. Therapist dropped me after session 1. Getting therapy is really difficult for me anyways, I was harrassed when I was younger to get it for other reasons by the school board when I attended middle school. Made a laughing stock out of me. It's left me with a terrible trauma. It took me an unbelievable amount of courage to even do it once. I don't know if I can do it again by myself.

Living in this giant new state all alone is killing me. My blood pressure is reaching dangerous levels. I haven't been able to cry for a really long time either. I'm stressed I'm second of the day. I usually go to bed around 5 AM because I just can't sleep. I simply wake up, go to work if I have it that day, and go home. I've been living here for a little over a year, and I haven't met a single person my age. It's either older people here, or brand new families. No inbetweens.

My life ended a long time ago, when I left where I grew up all my life. I have nobody and nothing here, and I never will.

This sounds really severe I think, but I don't care I said any of it. I know nobody here can't help me, this is professional stuff I need to look at if I ever can again. It just kinda helps me to write it sometimes, even if it's just a blissful second.

Hope this is the right place, I'm going to jump right in.

I live in Oregon, 29 now, license was suspended when I was 18 in Oregon for an unpaid marijuana ticket. Didn't really care to fight it because I really didn't know how and didn't pay for it because it was nonsense. Bad choice at the time, yes.

To note; I've gotten plenty of driving on suspended and driving without insurance tickets over the years. Still live in Oregon. 1 kid and 1 more on the way..

Fast forward to 2016, drove a coworker out of town to a train station using their car and ended up getting in a pretty bad solo wreck driving home(rolled car going 120 by cranking wheel to the left, no one else was on the road). I woke up in the hospital and the doctors said I had to get air lifted(thankfully to my hometown) because the surgeon was on vacation. And that I had to speak to an officer. 

Officer stated I had been found out a few hours after it happened outside the vehicle by train people. They said the seatbelt held so I somehow got myself out and crawled away from the vehicle and vaguely recall saying help and tasting dirt. 

I had been drinking (horrible choices, I know) and openly admitted to it as well as the hospital taking my blood while I was out, so I had figured I was going to be getting a DUI. After talking to the cop, he charged me with driving on suspended and driving without insurance tickets, but for some reason no DUI. I get air lifted home and make a full recovery. Cool.

Fast forward to 2019, end up speaking with a cop and giving my name, they run it and to my surprise had a warrant for failure to appear on a DUI. Apparently, like 6 months after the wreck, they had attempted to charge me through the mail but for some reason sent it to an address in a different town so I had no idea about it for all that time. So, boom, I go to jail. 

Since then, have complete diversion and all that good stuff at the end of 2019.  Had the blow n go device waved due to not having a license anyways, for the time.

From there, I figured okay I need to pay off all the fines I'd owe and/or start payment plans. So boom, did all that and paid off the majority en masse and then the county that let me I still make monthly payments to.

So, rolling up to DMV thinking I'm ready to do a driving test and stuff lol... They said they need an accident report from the wreck... The thing is, I don't even recall the type of car it was as it was a coworkers that they had just bought for $1000 and they did not have a license either so it wasn't registered to them and it had no insurance at the time. 

So I am not sure what to do about filling out the accident report without having the car info. Is there a way I can obtain that? I just don't know where to begin. 

I have sole custody of my kid and my partner lives out of town but is Prego and transitioning/moving to town in the next few months, so am trying to get my license back so I can stop having to worry about me driving.

My parents are trying to help me with everything but often just make me feel like shit. I feel alone in this world and i feel like no one else understands. I am diagnosed with bipolar and it affects everything I do. I need advice from people who have been through it.

Basically, I (26M) am having trouble figuring out a career decision, whether I should drop out of my master's degree, and how I'm not going to lose the home that my boyfriend and I live in. But I'm gonna do it chronologically.

To start with, I have about 60k in student loans from studying in the UK for my bachelors, and some from student maintenance that I took while doing my master's degree here at home. I recognize that this is going to weigh me down a bit until I'm 50, and I anticipated that and always sort of thought that things would be sorted by future, successful me.

I had to move back to my home country (and back home) in April 2020 when the pandemic hit (I graduated in 2019, and worked at a cinema until lockdown). Soon after that I fell in love with a guy, and we got together in the summer. Around here, I figured I had to do a late application to a master's degree, as this could allow me to get student maintenance for max 2 more years, and I could save some money while living back at my mom's until the job market stabilized, etc. I got admitted, and started studying full time although I definitely lacked discipline and a strong wish to actually study. But by being a media student again I was able to get a part time job at a prestigious PR firm, and I started working there part-time.

In February 2021 I could move from home and into a student apartment, together with my boyfriend (also a student but in a different city). It's a small but great flat, central in the city, and not expensive at all, which is a dream in a city where it is pretty much impossible to buy an affordable apartment or get a rental contract (this is really a big problem here in the city I live in, with 10-year long housing queues). It’s just dependent on that I study full time, and get 75% pass grades each term. They do checks after every term.

After more than a year as a student intern, I quit the PR gig in November because I realized this wasn't at all what I wanted to do. I found it boring and too much in the corporate-corporate world where I really disliked the vibes. I wanted to pursue a job closer to the interests where I’m more savvy, like graphic design, fashion etc, and found that a fashion brand where I had a connection was recruiting a graphic design intern. The position was full-time, and meagerly paid (500$/month, but hey, at least it's paid), but I had to apply because it seemed perfectly aligned to my taste and aesthetic and so on, and seemed like a great entry-way into a dream career. I ended up getting it while fully knowing that I also had my final master’s degree term left. That means I now have to write my master’s thesis at the same time as doing the full-time internship.

Now at this point I’ve worked one month at the brand full-time, while having written the beginning of my thesis (thankfully with a well-received topic and feedback from my supervisor so far). However, I’ve totally lacked work ethic in the study department, neglecting writing (as I always have had issues with these kinds of deadlines before), and instead placed my energy and performing well at work. I dread writing the thesis, can barely concentrate on reading, and I just don’t want to sit at my desk at home during the time I have off work. Therefore I’m thinking of dropping out / delaying the term, taking the risk at fully focusing on my internship (which might not even lead to full-time real employment.

This is where the housing situation comes in. I am on the contract as I study in the city and my boyfriend doesn't. I can transfer the contract over to him in September when he starts studying here, but the landlord needs my grades and thesis result before that. If I drop out/delay, we lose the flat, and basically have nowhere else to go.

This might seem easy: grow up, get focused, do your thesis, and quit the internship. After all a secure home is the most important thing. But I really do not want to quit the internship since there is a chance that I might get a real job there afterwards. Then I could start paying back my student loans. I have no idea what to do when I graduate in the summer without that sort of thing secured. Then again, me getting a job is not 100% certain either of course.

I feel immature and like my life is about to collapse. Either that or I will burn out severely. Also don’t know how to ask friends or family to help cause I just feel like a huge burden who set this all up myself.

TLDR: I am working and studying full-time and don’t know whether to drop out or leave the internship. Quitting uni will cost me my student apartment, I have nowhere else to live with my boyfriend. I have huge student loans that I am nowhere near being able to start paying back.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28652,public,self,"Huge student loans, full-time internship, master's thesis, might lose apartment soon.

I had no relationships at all, and I would really like to share my heart to someone. because I feel like something is missing. but the actual story is a bit different.

 I met a girl a few months ago and we both got along really really well. every time we spend time together it's the best thing and we enjoy it a lot. but the thing is we're friends and we're not dating. at first I really liked her at the beginning but because of my age, (I'm 19 but she's 22) we're going off as friends. and I am totally okay with this that we stay as friends. I enjoy our friendship, and it feels better off tbh.
I really like spending time with her, and she also mentions that she likes spending time with me. I get excited every time we're about to spend time.
when we think of plan ideas she usually gives ideas but don't really do it, despise me reminding her. and I don't blame her at all because she has a bit of a busy life, though she's a person that can still make time for something. and I feel a bit sad about this because we only have the best time when we're face to face. when we are apart we don't really message or send funny posts etc on social media and i feel like we stay a bit far away. When our final exams were over (we're in the same class) I thought that would be able to spend more time (because we have made so many plans!)
but sadly we couldn't. I tried to make it up she had to say no because of several reasons. normal me would have handled this normally but instead I felt really sad and I had a breakdown out of nowhere that I couldn't stop crying at all. of course I didn't say that I had breakdown to her but that's how I reacted I don't know why. 
I'm a bit of a lonely guy, I used to handle loneliness a lot better. but now I can't really stand being lonely anymore. could that be it? 
I feel like that was the stupidest breakdown of my life. but I still feel sad that we can't spend time.
I'm going back to my hometown two days later and she asked me when I'm going back a few days ago because she had to say no to our plan. I would really want to do something before I leave because I'm going to be out of here for a while, but I don't know if she forgot it or not and I don't want to come as clingy or annoying (because I'm the one who always reminds her).
as I said I like being this way I like being friends I don't think I would be in a relationship with her but why do I feel like I have something for her? for some reason hurts me a lot, i feel like I'm making myself depressed for something little.

I have recently become depressed on a level I don't think I have ever experienced, I go to sleep at like 7pm-8pm and can sleep until 3pm-4pm, I have no desire to play games anymore which was one of my favorite things to do, I have missed so much work because of my lack of motivation, I have gained weight. Etc. 

My mom has had to cover some of my bills when I don't have the full amount. Even tho she knows what I'm going through, she still says ""I go through shit too but I go to work"" well we aren't the same person. Then she proceeds to tac on money that I owe her when it's not even a lot. Her and my step das both work at around the $20/hr mark and full 40 hour weeks. 

Don't get me wrong here I plan on paying her I would have anyway but the fact that it's her going off on me and tying to lecture me while I'm going this shit, and don't really have a clear understanding why it blowing my mind. 

Everybody in her life even her kids walk a thin line, and if we really piss her off or do something that she feels it totally wrong or doing her wrong we get written off, I'm a special-ish case because we are a lot closer than all her other kids I have been there through her abuse with my late father, her anxiety that she had for 5-7 years that caused her not to be able to work at all basically, etc. 

But I am at a point of, just getting up and leaving. Not even letting her know just gone. I have no friends here in TX, haven't left my room in ages, broke. 

I haven't seen my dads side of the family I'm close 7 years, 80% of my family is in AZ including my grandma which is giving me the option to live with her for free, to save money, go out, find what it is that will make me happy, make friends, look for apartments etc. and I get to see all my cousins who were all baby's when I met them so they will not really know who I am, but my aunts and stuff as well. 

The thing that bothers me is losing my mom, she will be so pissed but at this point telling her anything will cause even more drama and bullshit while I'm still here she'll go off on me, it will be tense around the house until that point and I could go on, I really feel this will be good for me , but it's just the way I have to go about doing it is bothering me. Some of my friends say that if it's best for you and that's the only way then, do it.

I make $60K and i'm not passionate about the role, but the job is relatively easy with not too much work (Need to work and be available 8-5 but only 4-5 of actual work throughout the day).

I don't like California (except the Sierra Nevada area) and I love traveling so the past 5 months i've done just that. Ive traveled as far as North Carolina and back but mainly been in Colorado and Montana as I love the mountains and national parks out here. Ive been doing week long airbnbs in people houses which have worked out great going city to city and national park to national park on the weekends. During the week its just a normal work week for mw wherever I am. Work, cook, gym, etc. 

But it's tiring. I think the worst part is that I have no home base. The thing is I cant sign a lease anywhere because there have been talks for months about bringing us back in the office part time 2-3x a week. When they finally bring us back in, I am 100% going to ask them to stay remote. I don't want to go back into the office. I first have to get over the hurdle of letting them have me work remote (or doing a hotelling schedule maybe with me coming back in a few days a month I would be open to) and then I have to make sure they have tex setups in the state im in (I heard they only have tax setups in California, Arizona, and Oregon).

I know this next part is a good problem to have, but my Uncle is going to buy me a house up to $450,000 anywhere I want to be when I settle down and pick an area I like with a job. He tells me no rush (literally can wait years). I obviously cant pick a place right now to buy let alone even sign a lease because they could bring me back in the office literally any day, could be next week could be in 6 months. 

Beyond that, regarding macro life situation, I am having fun traveling, but i'm 30, have hit almost every major area of the country that I want to explore, and want to obviously eventually get married or so by the age of 35ish. I feel like I am kind of wasting time a bit. I mean I am working, making money, saving money, supporting myself, but I am not building a home base or anything. I go to the gym, relatively good looking, but have gotten so used to doing my own thing and traveling and hiking that I havent been on a date in over a year. Kind of feel I am not doing the responsible thing. 

And even if I could pick somewhere, I don't know where. I love the mountains and dislike cities, which is what is drawing me to the Colorado and Montana area. But $450K, even all cash, can only get you so much in those area because they are so popular. I do like living in open space a bit away from the city but there are 2 problems with this. 1. Regarding work and future work, I don't know how long I can sustain working remote, and even If they do give me the go ahead with 100% remote, what happens if something happens with that job, I would be out of luck living out of a job market. How do people living away from a major city or even living in a smaller city do it? Should i plan accordingly based on future job roles? I have account management and recruiting experience although I dont like recruiting. 

2. And finally, I feel like I am living a lifestyle thats just my own without regard for the future. And if I get a place not near a big city where I can just hike and travel while working remotely, I'll end up 45 and single which I dont want.

I’m a 23 year old Architectural Engineering graduate who has started a corporate job that I actually never wanted and surprise surprise, it feels like my soul is being sucked out of me with every passing day.

Before this, I was self-employed. I used to paint custom shoes and design artwork for t-shirts. The clothing side of my small business is still doing relatively well but it’s not making enough to sustain my lifestyle.

That’s where this job comes in. It’s stable income, the work is… sometimes fun, mostly boring… I just don’t feel fulfilled.

Part of me knew this would happen because I have a very entrepreneurial mindset and working for someone else just feels weird but yeah, I’m getting off-topic.

Anyway, I’ve always had an interest in Japanese architecture and garden design and I was wondering if anyone had any tips for me?

I’ve looked into Horticultural Apprenticeships in the UK but none of them really lead down the path of Japanese garden design. I’d love to work in Japan for experience as well but that’s a whole other story. I don’t know… my life goal is to design my own tiny house on a farm and just mind my own business but it’s looking impossible right now when I have no idea what my next steps should be…

Working this 9-5 for the next couple months will be the death of me so that isn’t an option. Gary V says we should go out there and try as much shit as we can until we eventually find what we want to do with our lives but I don’t have that financial luxury right now…

As the eldest daughter of an immigrant asian family, the responsibility on my shoulders is insane. I don’t know if any of you can relate but most of us asian kids have been brainwashed since birth to study hard, go to uni, get a 9-5, and work like mad to make money so we can enjoy life and not have to suffer like our parents. I think they missed the part where working a 9-5 means you don’t exactly get to enjoy life as much as you actually want.

I don’t know… I want to pursue this entrepreneur thing but I also want to design gardens…

To be honest, it’s not like it has been very easy at my current job. I worked myself so hard, I didn’t get a chance to breathe.

Big surprise, I ended up tanking the exam too. 
I think I’m doing decently well at my current job, but I’ve hit a blocker now where I need a professional degree/masters degree to grow and get promoted. Even otherwise, I gave myself 2 years before I got out and gave exams for higher eduction.

Things im worried about that I can change 

Driver's licence (got my learners), didn't have a job yet, I didn't practice proper health hygiene, skin care, didn't eat right, didn't care for myself as much, no friends in life, no relationships


The reason I didn't practice theses things were due to me playing 120 hours a week gaming and hating life due to depression and being alone and also trouble finding people I generally like with the same relationship values and morals.

Also made myself miserable.

I also have other life things due to not having a normal life since, I live with grandparents and they aren't normal parents so life advice isn't great as traditional parenting and I never got that, so its one thing I want to overcome mentally.

I've tried my best for a routine and health benefits like eating right and my grandparents think im crazy or obsessed with it when I just want to practice healthy. 

My uncle does the same thing and complains that it doest matter since my grandparents are 80 years old and they had a good life so why does it matter if you eat healthy or diet since hes seen people die regardless of what they do to them self.


The are supportive in other aspects like letting me live if I do study a course but my grandparents aren't parents.

How best to overcome that I couldn't be the person I would've like to be due to my selfish parents and not giving me a normal life like most kids in school.

I'm on the fence about love advice: I'm at a crossroads because I'm getting advice irl from different sides. 

So I was part of this friend group my old job, where I felt like I didn't quite fit in. Except with one guy, (let's say Kyle). He was nice to me compared to the girls in the group, and always included me in things. For example, if everyone was going somewhere together, he would  see me and invite me. We also had some favorite shows in common, and we'd talk about them for a while. However, I noticed that one of the girls in the group (let's call her Jackie) had her claws in him-- sometimes when he would be talking to me, he'd suddenly say, ""Jackie doesn't like it if I say that.""

However, he and Jackie weren't in a relationship. But she would always cling on to him. For example, there was a Halloween party, and she pretended to be drunk so she could literally cling to him all night. This other time I mentioned in front of both of them of the time I gave him a lift, and she got quiet and was visibly unhappy. 

I didn't understand their relationship because he would hang out with her outside of work, and didn't give me a response anytime I'd propose getting dinner too. So I thought he truly wasn't interested in me. 

He had to move back to Texas for work (since we were in NJ). We had a long talk a few days before he left, but I didn't tell him how I felt because guys had treated me like crap once they found out I liked them. He didn't tell me anything either. On the day he left, he looked like he was going to cry after he hugged me. 

After that, I just tried to move on, thinking he never liked me. Plus Jackie and I worked together, so I didn't want contention with her. A few years later, my sister told me that Kyle probably liked me, and he was afraid to act because Jackie had a higher position at work. 

I just rolled my eyes and cut my losses because I used to talk to him on Facebook from time to time. However, he'd stopped responding last year. Sister def thought he had a girlfriend. 

Lately, I added him on a different online platform, and he started messaging me. After that, we texted for 2 hours non-stop about our lives, and then for like 1 hour a few days later. However, I notice that he doesn't reply much to me again now, other than a few words. I subtly tried to find out if he has a girlfriend, but he hasn't given me a straight answer. 

What do you guys think? If he didn't like me as a friend at least, why did he text me for so long? And then why did he suddenly stop? (If he was an online dating guy, I'd get it. But I'm confused because we're friends...or I thought we were?)

TLDR: Crush from old job started talking to me again, but abruptly stopped. I hinted at the question if he has a girlfriend, and he never gave a direct answer.

I’ve been living with my bf for like 4years and I’ve been with him for longer. We have a dog and live in a rented 1br apartment. Things are pretty content. I feel like things could go on as they are for a long time and we’d be happy. 

The thing is I don’t want to have kids and my bf does. We’re both 30, and he’s been mentioning more and more frequently that he’d have proposed already if I wanted to have kids. I don’t particularly care about being married, but he does. It all boils down to I’m content with how things are and he wants other stuff. (His parents are also pressuring him to buy a house, and asking us about babies and marriage and stuff. Tbh I don’t think he’d be as fussed about it if his parents didn’t bring it up literally every time the talk. My mom is a lot more chill about this stuff). These are all really big incompatibility issues, and we’re overdue for a big discussion about them, but I feel like it’s almost inevitable that we’d break up. 

It’s selfish, but I don’t want to have that big talk until I’m in a better situation to be on my own. 

Issue #1: Right now my work schedule wouldn’t work for my doggie, who would come with me if my bf and I broke up. We change schedules every July and I could try for a better one but we choose by seniority and I’m pretty low on the list. The job also keeps me in a very high cost of living area, and I don’t really have ties here (most of my friends moved away). I’ve been looking for a while for a job I can do remotely but it either needs to pay a particular amount or be public service/nonprofit so I don’t drown in my student loans. I’m still looking for a job like this but I’d most likely be changing fields so it’s a little hard. 

Issue #2: I need to find a place to live. As I mentioned I’m in a very high COL area and I have a little dog who’ll be with me. I either get a remote job where I could go someplace cheaper, or find a place to live close enough to my office and adjust my schedule so I can do my current job. I’d prefer to find a new, job that can be at least a bit remote. 

Issue #3: I generally use my bfs car to commute because mine died in 2020 and since my bfs job went remote he wasn’t using it, so I’d need a car too. 

Issue #4: my dog would 100% come with me but I think he’d miss my bf. Also my dog’s vet and groomer and daycare are obviously in the area I’m currently in. He’s a rescue and pretty shy so we built up a lot of trust with those places, and if we moved we’d need to either stick close to the area or find new dog stuff. 

I just feel like an asshole making all these plans before actually talking to my bf. I just feel like once we talk that’s going to be it, and I’ll need to have a plan set up. Kids aren’t a thing either of us should have to compromise on but I don’t want to eject myself out of this relationship and into a bad situation.

So, at my current job, a lot of things have been going pretty badly, I'm at a point where it doesn't matter whether someone is right or wrong, I don't care. it's just too much right now and last week I thought to myself t's time to leave"" and followed by incredible happiness and a sense of ease. That was when I realized that it was really time.

I haven't left yet, I'm was on sick leave and doing some interviews and have been waiting on those results to then hand in my notice.   


But basically, my bottled-up emotions and stress that got recognized only then, and made me realize that I just want to run away from my problems in my own way, making me become somewhat irresponsible. I stopped eating properly, exercising regularly, sleeping and waking up consistently, showering daily.  
I basically ran away from my own responsibilities to play video games and forget for an entire week. I just don't feel like I have any mental capacity to handle anything, nor energy. I don't want to go back to work, not right now, I don't feel ready.

Now with my sick leave over and having to go back to my current job in corporate recruitment, I realize this is not an option anymore, not after realizing how bad that place makes me feel. And all of this is tying into a sense of unease that is growing because of my thoughts about bills and unemployment

I don't know where to start. How do I stop running away from my own responsibilities? How do I recover my mental capacity and ability to handle these stresses? I'm 30 and living in a foreign country, but I feel like I just want to tuck away in an isolated area and not see anyone for a couple of months until I completely forget the stresses of my current life/job and recharge.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28630,public,self,It feels like everything is a bit too much right now.

I currently feel like I am in a point in my life where I am at a crossroads. Anyways, let me give a little background. Also, I apologize as this is super long.

I (24f) and last Spring graduated college from a prestigious college in the Northeast. I absolutely love what I majored and minored in. In addition, I was given a great opportunity for an HR internship that I worked at for a year before I graduated. I knew HR would be something I would like to do but not necessarily sure that would be something I wanted to do forever as I am an avid writer and like to be creative thinker outside of my academics. Anyways, this past September I was offered a full-time position in the area I grew up in/attended college at. The first few months were great to be honest, but with a change in leadership I have grown to resent my job a little bit. I don’t want to say my manager and I butt heads but I constantly feel like I’m walking on eggshells and leads me to feel like I am not completing my best work because I am always on edge. Also, with the ongoing inflation and hopes to move out soon, it was a little bit discouraging to hear that I get the paid the same amount as some of the interns we just hired on (I am paid hourly as well for context). I understand that you need to just put up and shut up for the first few years of entering the workforce, but like I said there are just some things that I feel like could be going better for me. 

Anyways, to go into my proposed solution to fix this problem, I am also in a long distance relationship with my significant other in the military. He (23m) and I have been together for about 3 years and have been long distance for about 90% of our relationship. (We are also both from the same town, but he went away for college and now the military obviously) We are both very independent and have worked extremely hard to get to where we are today. Also, our long distance relationship has exposed us to many hardships, building strong trust and effectively communicate our feelings with each other.  Through those experiences, we both know that we want each other for the long run and are very sick of constantly spending money to see each other for a short period of time. We are just ready to move in together and start our lives. 

Luckily we just found out his next duty station is a little over 3 hours from our hometown/where I currently live and he will move there in July. I also just applied to graduate school that is about 40 minutes away from that base he is moving to. So I guess stars are aligning in some ways if I end up getting accepted to the program? But getting to the point, I just feel like I should start over somewhere else. I have lived here for my whole life and I know that this world has so much more to offer than this small town. I know there are some repercussions with this life choice, for example the possibility of not finding a job right away, getting criticism from others (more specifically family) for leaving this job I’m currently at and the list goes on. I also understand that it is considered “taboo” to leave a job straight after graduating from college as quickly as I would like to. However, I believe that I am at the perfect age to still go back to school and move somewhere else to offer me more opportunities and connections. In addition, I feel that the company I am currently at will most likely not provide me an adequate compensation/advancement I need to make a living. I say this based on our many exiting surveys I have reviewed as apart of my position. Also, the average retention is about 2-3 years. Many of the issues mentioned from these former employees relate to lack of mobility and pay wasn’t sufficient. 

So if someone can give me some advice or even criticism it would be great. Also, I am not looking to quit my job right now, however, I have been job searching and updating my resume any chance I get. These are just my accumulated thoughts over the past few months so I’m not taking this lightly as I have listed the pros and cons of each option. Lol I’d like to think I have my head on straight.

I’m (23M) from Iran and I’m a 5th year dentistry student. What’s bugging me out recently is that I really want to leave this country, I actually don’t wanna take the time to explain why, long story short I like nothing about here. I just feel like I was born on the wrong place on erath.
As I told you I’m a dentistry student, the main reason that I studied dentistry is that in a poor country like Iran there are only a few jobs which you can have a stable life with in the future, and I didn’t actually choose it because I was interested in it, I was kinda forced to go into this path by my parents. But unfortunately Dentistry and in general Medical courses are pretty hard for getting an application from foreign universities. Way harder than courses like software engineering or anything computer-related which actually was my interest. But my parents were only looking at the future I would have in Iran, and at the time I was just so confused and under the pressure of university entrance exam (which is preety in hard in Iran) that I couldn’t think about this stuff.
Now I feel like I’m trapped. I’ll probably have an economically stable life because of my career but I don’t really enjoy it. I would’ve prepared having a normal life, doing a job I like and living in a country I love. But all that seems so far away now and I feel like I’ve wasted my years.

I am sort of a Tom boy so it was basically a group of all boys, and in this group I met this amazing boy. Some context before everything unfolds: I grew up in a horrible house hold and never really learned how to socialize properly and I struggle with a bunch of mental disorders and illnesses. So me and this boy really hit it off and we started talking a lot until he took me out and asked me to be his girlfriend. He was different then any guy I’ve ever met, he always made sure I was safe and comfortable and he was so loving. However through out the relationship I had a falling out with his friends and they said I was faking all my mental issues and they would always shit talk me to my bf. That didn’t get in the way, we still had an extremely strong relationship and such a deep bond with eachother, and he’s shown me more love than I have ever had in my life. I’ve always struggled with fitting in and he made me feel like I belonged. We were convinced we were going to be with eachother forever but we started drifting away and I don’t know what happened but he just kinda stopped loving me. He started constantly annoying me and hanging out with his friends 24/7. I felt so upset, I mean I was his girlfriend and I lashed out at him which I know I shouldn’t have, and I’m in the wrong. But I started treating him like how he was treating me. I always left him love notes but he would never do anything for me like that. We recently agreed to both breakup because he didn’t really see me as a girlfriend and hadn’t for about 2 weeks, and I’m absolutely heartbroken. We were perfect for eachother, and then we drifted away. We were convinced we were going to marry eachother and that we were each others loved of their lives, and that we would grow old together. He was literally my dream guy. We had so many cute little inside jokes and gestures and so many things remind me of him. I really want a second chance. I really do. I doubt that will happen though.

I majored in German and Russian because it was all I was good at and all that I wanted to study. I absolutely love studying foreign languages and I know for sure that I want a career that would allow (or require) me to use foreign languages every day. 

Shortly before graduating, I got hired for a job teaching English in Japan, mostly because I've been interested in the country since I was a kid and I want to learn the language. If all goes well, I will be able to start the job in the coming months. The thing is, I've completely fallen in love with learning the language and I'm making great progress with it; I would actually love to learn it better and use it professionally. The problem is that it's completely unrelated to my degree. 

I feel like I have this big sign plastered to my face that says ""German &amp; Russian"" because whenever someone finds out that I studied those languages at uni, they assume I'm fluent and think I'm stupid for not simply pursuing a career with it. My German is pretty good, my Russian isn't much stronger than what I learned in school. But like I said, Japanese is the one I actually enjoy.

I feel like after my time teaching English, no matter if I'm still in Japan or back in the States, I'll have trouble finding a job because I'm not really passionate about/developing the skills I went to school for. Going back to school is always an option, but I have no idea what I would study anyway.

Actually the story is a bit more cool than that, because I started talking to her at an event and we really hit it off while we were waiting for our separate groups of friends to arrive. Turns out the group of friends were the exact same crowd!

To be honest I kind of fell a bit in love with her almost immediately. We went to more events together with this friendship group and we had a really good friendship going. Then after one particularly fun night I fucked it all up by sending her flowers the next day. Things got really awkward and she said she's going to need some time away from me but perhaps we'll be able to be friends in the future after some time. As you can imagine I was just absolutely crippled with pain and self anger at doing something so obviously cringey out of the blue.

It's been nearly 2 years since that incident and recently saw her with that same crowd at a party and once again had a fantastic time with her. So all the emotion I felt for her has come rushing back, and went and fucked up again by texting her directly, didn't say anything in particular, just commenting that I've had an enjoyable evening listening to some music. The problem is something simple like that has these overtones of me trying to engage on a personal level and it just sounds so awkward.

The absolutely worst part is that I think if I had just been 'chilled' that time before I think there may have been a chance of something happening. I don't think it's possible for someone to hit it off so well and for the feelings to be completely one sided.

Now I'm going into another thought pattern that I'm wondering if it's completely delusional and just going to destroy things again. Next time I see her I'm planning on telling her that I've accepted we will never be together and apologise for screwing things up so badly and I just want to remove all the awkwardness between us. But I'm also going to say I won't apologise for wanting more with her, and telling her all the things I find so wonderful about her.  In my fantasy of this conversation, she gets a tear in her eye and says 'don't think nothing can happen between us' and then kisses me.

That's the movie script version of how it feels my life could change to an almost unrecognisable version of happiness that I haven't experienced in such a long time. Problem is I'm also terrified of her freaking out and it being the last time I ever see her with that feeling of rejection like a physical agony in my stomach. 

I'm so well liked in this group of friends, I've never felt so validated by such a great group of people, but when it comes to romantic subtlety with her, I just feel so completely lost, confused and hurt.

I go by donyatraveler, it’s nice to meet all of you.

I am by no means a professional writer. I enjoy writing as a hobby, so pardon my occasional grammatical and syntax errors. On most occasions, I like to write about deep topics such as existentialism and love. 

I like to write because of the chaotic and tragic nature of life. I am not the best speaker, so I prefer to express myself through writing. I find this very therapeutic especially because I feel so deeply and I write to make sense of the tragedy that surrounds us on a daily basis.

Today my writing will be about the visceral pain which heartbreak causes. I know this is a cliche topic, but bear with me, I want to share my feelings with you all, in hope that many of you will find solace that this excruciating and agonizing feeling is universal and that you may acknowledge that you are not alone.

Again? I feel that this time is different. I have gone through enough. I deserve love. Everyone deserves love and affection. Everyone deserves to be held, to be told all will be okay, to belong. So after many years of finding love, being hurt, disrespected, I thought you were different. 

But before I talk about you, I want to talk about the others. I want to talk about the time I thought I found love. I want to talk about the time I thought I found my soulmate. 

When I was 18, I fell in love for the first time. Even though I was technically an adult, I felt so childish, so ashamed of even thinking I was ready to fall in love but I did. I will not detail the events surrounding this situation despite my anonymity. However, I will gladly disclose my thoughts and feelings.

Despite how kind and giving I was to the recipient of my love, my love was unrequited. I am well aware that unrequited love is common but for me it felt so agonizing. Every bone in my body did not want to accept the fact that he did not want to return my love, even though he had every right to do so. I did not have a good relationship with my mother growing up and my parents fought all the time, so I did not have an example to look up to when it came to love. Alas, this is why the unrequited love was difficult to accept, it was because I did not love myself. I did not know how to. I struggled with confidence growing up because I did not have a parent who regularly reminded me how beautiful I am, how capable I am, how strong I am. Since I was not emotionally validated as a child, I attempted to look for love and validation from others. It was absolutely devastating being reminded by many people, whom I regarded as close friends, that I was not deserving of their love and support. Even more upsetting, was being disappointed by romantic interests. I was repeatedly taken advantage of because by nature I was very compassionate and empathetic. 

When I was 18, I remember thinking, “if I treat him nicely, if I am kind to him and attempt to look pretty for him, he will definitely like me”. I was so desperate for validation. My soul craved it. I never had a relationship that made me feel like I was enough. I did not have anyone tell me on a regular basis growing up that I was pretty, rather I was physically and verbally abused. I internalized a very, very sad fact, that I was simply unlovable. Despite that claim, I strove constantly, to gain the approval and admiration of others. Crying myself to sleep sometimes, I’d say to myself, “all I ever wanted was someone to hug me, to tell me they loved me and for once, to vow to never ever leave me.”

Between the ages of 18 and my current age, I struggled with self-love and self-compassion. Confidence was a challenge. It seemed to be a fundamental truth of my life, that there was no way anyone was going to stay, that everyone leaves. But I still harbored hope and optimism, that eventually my time will come. I contemplated suicide many times and I still do. The impact of feeling as if you are not enough, of feeling that you are insignificant, of feeling your heart break so many times—that really does something to you. I immediately started feeling depressed and anxious. The feeling that my potential friendships and relationships may end at any time, that I will be betrayed, that I will be neglected, is a matter that is very harrowing, yet possible.

The feeling of being alone is the one of the worst feelings in the world and it is unbearable. I never got used to it. We are human and we are a social species. We need companionship and we want to feel like we matter. Living this life alone can make living intolerable. We need to be able to have someone on our side for support, but what can happen to someone that must go through life’s trials all alone? I was one to go through many adversities alone, crying myself to sleep and occasionally hug myself and tell myself I was going to be okay. I was going to be okay but now I was upset and hopeless. I reminded myself that every misfortune will soon pass.

I contemplated a lot. I reflected on the past and my soft nature. My journey to not just love but self-love proved to be an arduous task and it is still ongoing. I am sure I will spend my whole life in pursue of this goal. I accepted that I must struggle and hurt in order to one day, be victorious. But I must admit, it is emotionally exhausting. When I am open-minded about an individual I am interested in, it proves to be a disappointment. Mentally, I think, “all these failures, it must confirm the claim that I am worthless and that I cannot possibly be valued” or “I am destined to be alone forever”, or even more, the claim that “I want to die—existing is so painful”.

My latest relationship seemed to be the last straw. The last straw that may cause me to call it quits on everything. I met someone a few months ago. We clicked instantly and went on many dates. We texted constantly and talked all the time. I started thinking he might be different. Then after 40 days, he told me that he had a lot going on and that he felt like he had trouble sleeping, suffered from anxiety and shockingly, this relationship contributed to this stress. Not only that, he informed me that prior to talking to me, he had ended a relationship 3 weeks prior. He seemed very distressed as he was telling me and we agreed to take a break. After some time, we decided to resume our relationship. The next couple months were amazing. We enjoyed each others company and went on multiple dates. But I started noticing that he had trouble expressing his feelings for me. Whenever we’d talk about it, he’d state that he liked me but would not elaborate. We continued to hang out get very close. Then, not long ago, he startled me with a shocking announcement. He told me that he does not have any romantic feelings for me and that he had trouble being expressive and emotionally available for years. He also told me that school and work were taking a toll on him. He told me that he was thinking about therapy and I said that it was absolutely critical that he looked into that as soon as possible. He then suggested we take a “3-4 day break” because school was extremely overwhelming, adding that at times, this relationship caused him some stress as well. 

This was a heavy blow. I was not ready for such a shocking turn. Our relationship had some bumps but after the initial break, I really thought we were fine. I thought about how I was deceived and how my relationship with him may have been a huge lie. The lack of emotional availability despite us being together, getting close and going on enjoyable dates really perplexed me. I started thinking that this relationship to him was perhaps, always a diversion. I also could not envision a possibility where I can move on from this startling confession. If he has no romantic feelings for me, what is the foundation of the relationship? I immediately thought about every single time we held hands, kissed and hugged, and how that probably meant nothing to him…

I cried my way back home. I cried myself to sleep and I was absolutely miserable. No words can possibly the agonizing pain that I felt all over my body. All I felt was despair, that after this many fails, I was destined to failure. There is no way I could find a healthy love, a love that will not desert me. I felt dejected, because my many attempts were causing me a lot of grief. Maybe some of you can relate, but this may be one of the worst feelings you can ever experience—the distressing realization that perhaps, you may never find love. I felt empty and very hopeless. Most of all, I was very resentful. I felt used by him and I did not feel valued.

In closing, my beautiful Redditors, I ask you to be patient in the midst of chaos and tragedy that afflicts our world, for it is a part of life. Despite my disappointment and painful reality, a tiny glimmer of hope persists. That hope keeps me alive. Without that hope, I would have thrown myself off a bridge a long time ago. It is unbearable to feel alone and feel that you are not deserving of love, but I am here to tell you, every single one of you do. Every single person in the world. The ones who have existed before us. The ones who presently exist. The ones who will exist in the future. Every single human being deserves love, affection and validation. Every single one of you matters. I do not know any of you, but I hope nothing but love, respect, kindness and affection from those you regard as very special.

For the parents on here, please be kind to your kids. Tell them you love them. Please do so. They need to hear that from you, or they will attempt to find it from other people. Your kids need to be loved by you before they can be loved by anyone else.

Finally, I would like to remind each and every one of you to be kind. Be kind to one another. Respect and value your loved ones because life is too short. If we want our future to be even remotely better, we must start with ourselves. Please try to be good—good to yourself and good to others.

And most importantly, with or without the love of another, I want you to know, oh anonymous stranger, that I am sending the tiny amount of love I have in my heart, to you—

Take care,

Please excuse me if this seems disjointed, I'm not sure where to begin and end.  


I'm a f 42 year old freelance creative and I stay with my wife and 5 cats we rescued from a neglectful owner (that we are trying to re-home) . We stay in South Africa, my wife has no official identity documentation even though she was born here because of a government error, so she can't get ""on the books"" work, my income mostly supports us both,, but a few years ago I was stabbed multiple times during a mugging and because of my financial circumstances at the time, I couldn't secure proper treatment after being patched up so my physical capacity for work has been reduced by the aftermath of my injuries.  


We both have numerous health issues aside from that , we both need to get to the dentist, optometrist, counsellor, my wife needs a gynae fairly urgently too, but with our minimal resources we can't afford it and with her lack of identity, she can't get anything beyond an initial consultation unless we can afford to bribe our way to treatment. The process to secure her identity is also a costly one, it involves DNA testing.  


It's all getting to me. I try to stay positive and productive because I feel like the anchor here. I need to earn more, but I can barely manage what I take on. I feel like the anxiety is obscuring my access to my abilities, I can't think straight, so my work suffers, and t hen we all suffer.  Our families are largely unsympathetic/unhelpful and a lot of the people we know don't seem to be around our situation. So we feel isolated in all of this.

I'm lost at the moment as college (UK 16-18) was the worst of experiences with covid not making it better and I basically failed my courses. My gcse or secondary school levels and very high however and I prefferably go into an apprentiship or go back into education again at this point in my life.

I don't have close people I can get sound advice from and my mum's extent of helping so far has been not kicking me out as soon as I turned 18.

I traveled to Australia from the UK with some friends for a holiday. 
I met a guy(my now ex) and we hit it off straight away. He was considerably older than me. In his late 30’s and I in my early 20’s. I really liked this guy, I just had a really good feeling. I returned home to UK and stayed in contact with said guy for a long time. We decided to make a go of a long distance relationship. After 9 months, I left my life in the UK to move to Australia for good and make a go of the relationship. Things were good at first, the honeymoon period I guess. About a year into the relationship I found explicit photos of another woman on his laptop - dating from when I was back in the UK, but we were officially in a relationship together. This woman had added me on social media accounts, obviously I didnt know who she was at the time, but she had the name of a pub where my ex was living in her account name, so I figured he must know her and thought she was possibly trying to become friends with me as I was moving there shortly. My ex said he didn’t know who she was and her name didn’t ring a bell. Anyway- fast forward to finding the laptop photos - turns out he had been sleeping with said woman who he ‘didn’t know’. 
I forgave him for this as I figured it was when I was back home, even though we were in a relationship, he had not done anything wrong to me since I had made the move to Aus. 

Things were becoming to get quite uncomfortable for me. We lived on an island with only 1 night club/hostel which is where we both worked and drank with our friends. 
He was not a good drinker and we argued pretty much every time. He was always around other women and making me feel a bit of a chick in the background when he was drunk. 
Some nights when we got home things were really bad - he smashed a glass over me during an argument. I didn’t know anyone too well at this point and felt there was no one to really reach out to. I called my parents and he shouted in the background calling my father(whom he had never met yet) a c**t. 
He poured a whole 2litre bottle of soft drink over me, threw water in my face in the middle of the bar to which I retaliated to, stupidly, and did it back. He was drunk and told me that I should go and watch porn, then I might know what I am doing in bed. I forgave him for all of this, even though it would still be in the back of my mind. I started to dread being invited out if drinking was involved, worrying what kind of events would unfold at home. 

Fast forward 4 years into the relationship, 
We applied for a partner visa. I paid for the whole thing($8,000) paying for his half too. All of my other friends on the same visa paid for half, and their partner paid for their half. I was a little disheartened that I paid for it all, I asked him and he said he had bills to pay etc etc, that he tries to provide for us and I should be grateful for that. 
Anyway moving on..
Things were up and down and I was starting to feel quite lonely and worthless. There was no intimacy anymore really. I used to cringe when he would initiate sex. I don’t know why? Still dont. Maybe because I wanted attention in other ways, not just sex. And I never got any of that.  I found myself going a little crazy, desperate for a little more attention and affection. I used to try and talk to him about issues I felt were surfacing, he would instantly become defensive and turn things around on me, saying ‘yeah.. well you do this that I don’t like’ etc. which I would listen to and apologise for. But my problems were not important to him, he would say what he needed to say and my issues were never spoken about or resolved, just brushed under the carpet. It became hard for me as a lot of anger and resentment started to build up. I tried so hard to get it off my chest but he really would not listen and I found myself time and time again just settling for it, because we had good days and it’s very easy to think that things are not so bad then. We would have a bad day or an argument and all of my unresolved problems resurfaced again. 
Still 4 years into the relationship, he went out with the boys. Which I wasn’t allowed to go to. 
He would get so drunk to the point he couldn’t even stand up. I used to feel sick and have atrocious anxiety when he would go out. The morning after I went to work as normal, he came home eventually and I found out he had kissed another woman and the bar. It turns out a few of my girlfriends were there and they told him he needed to tell me. He did tell me and he was disgusted and upset. But he didn’t remember it, only because he had been told about it by a friend. Again, I forgave him. Moved on. I came here for a reason, made a new life, new friends and had a new job, and didn’t want to feel like a failure. 
A few weeks later he got blind drunk again. I stayed home. He came home, we had an argument and he called me a fat slag. I was absolutely distraught. How can someone who loves me, and someone who I made such a big sacrifice for call me such a name. This upset me more than him cheating twice. 

I was at breaking point with everything, my brain was doing over time. 5 years in total we were together, he never once bothered to visit my family with me. We never went on a holiday, Whenever I tried to talk about marriage or children he would switch off and seem so disinterested. Our friends would have a joke and ask when he would pop the question and he would laugh and have a ‘pffft’ response. I wondered what was wrong with me. I was so heartbroken and just unsure what was going on. He wasn’t the best at talking about his feelings. Maybe he just struggled to express them. But I felt like a complete worthless POS. My mental health was at an all time low, I had never suffered with mental health before. I had thoughts of ending my life because I felt so stuck and not good enough. I regretted ever moving here for him. I was so resentful but so reluctant to give up. 

Eventually, recently, I became close to a friend and Co worker. We had a lot of deep conversations and connected on a different level. We kissed once, on a night out. And I felt a mixture of relief and guilt. I told my partner as this behaviour is completely out of character for me and I just couldn’t live with it. I realised that something is very wrong, and if my relationship was so amazing then I would never have kissed another person. I told my partner and told him I wanted out of the relationship. He was upset of course. I went to go and stay at a friends house but he wouldn’t let me. He wanted to know where I was 24/7. He checked the cameras at the club we worked at to see what I was up to all of the time. I did eventually go and stay with a friend for a couple of nights, and found he had taken my house key out of my bag so that I wouldn’t be able to return home - he gave me it back eventually. 
I came home to the whole house packed up of my belongings. He packed all of my stuff. And I just left. A week later he reached out and was very civil, things were actually good. Then it all changed, For 6 months he sent me abusive messages which is fair enough as I had obviously upset him. I let him be angry and have his space. He shared posts on Facebook about me, He told our social circle that I had a full blown affair over a period of time, which I did NOT. But he will not believe me. I am dead to him. I explained to him that all of that is why I wanted to leave, he said ‘if the things from the past are your reason for leaving then that’s your own problem’. I also stressed to him that he had cheated on me twice. His response was ‘yes I did but at least I didn’t run off with them’. 
My name to pretty much everyone is dirt now - deserved I guess? We have the same friendship group and things are very hard. He segregated me from everyone for 6 months. I still haven’t bothered to tell anyone my side of the story because I don’t really have the energy, nor see the point. 
I have heard he is seeing someone else now - and I am having a hard time dealing with it and I don’t know why.

I am now in a relationship with mentioned friend/coworker and I feel rather content and I feel I am appreciated so much more. I just wish I could totally forget my ex and move on with my life, I do not know why I still think about him. But we still live on this small island together and as stated before, have the same group of friends. We also have a dog together who I miss so much but he will not let me see him anymore. I feel like I don’t have any friends anymore. I never want to socialise incase he is there as I just feel so uncomfortable and I also do not want to put any of our friends in an awkward position. But he does whatever he wants because I am the bad person in this situation. I feel like it’s me against the world and I feel sad having to walk around knowing people have this negative opinion of me because nobody really knows my side of the story, I stayed silent the whole time afterwards.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28603,public,self,I left my partner to be with somebody else.

I’m a uni student and a lot of people would think I have a great life. I have a nice car, would consider myself pretty good looking, 6’4 fairly good physique, great happy family and making insane amounts of money with crypto so I’m not poor by any means.

But I’m just kinda useless at socialising (when it comes to females anyway) and I’ve more or less always been like that, and it’s kinda starting to grind me down. I can’t keep just jacking off forever lol. It’s just kinda torturing me at this point.

Is probably useful to mention I have Asperger’s syndrome (was never formally diagnosed but seen by psychologists etc who r convinced I have it). I’m not like undateables level and most people would prob think I’m no different than anyone else but probably doesn’t help especially with females.

Always struggled with making friends throughout school and never really had any proper friends. Got bullied a lot as well in school so I was by myself a lot of the time. Also when I was around 15 I got in big trouble with technology (long story) but my school / parents banned me from any devices or social media for around 2.5 years which never helped in terms of socialising. Had literally 0 proper friends, never visited any friends (couple outside school but kinda irrelevant) or went to parties etc. Nowhere near feeling suicidal although have been in the past.

Ended up in uni (wanted a degree apprenticeship but didn’t work out) and was during covid (for 1st year anyway) which of course didn’t help things.

I have a couple friends from uni but not really that close (just see them in classes etc). I’m switching uni courses which I’m happy about so kinda have a few months with barely much uni workload at all which I’m spending most of my time working on crypto. Also in a uni club and get on great with others there, though no girls there which I would be attracted to.

Friends (or lack of) doesn’t really both me too much, it’s females. I’ve never lost my virginity and it’s something that I feel really embarrassed about, and being almost 20 y/o man sex is something that goes thru my head nearly all the time. I tried tinder but not really any luck with it, don’t really have any good photos of myself and looks embarrassing to have pictures of myself with no friends or anything. And scrolling thru insta or tiktok etc and seeing beautiful girls gets kinda depressing knowing I have no chance (at least currently anyway)

Would love a gf but not really my main goal, one night stands would make me happy haha. Don’t have much of a high bar as long as they’re half decent that’s fine. Hoping to buy my own flat near my uni this year so I imagine that would make it easier to get laid  lol.

Any advice for making yourself look good on tinder then I suppose, or how to just get girls in general?

Let me give you a peek into my weekly schedule:

M: Gym 7:10-8:25, class 9:10-10:00, work 11-4

T: PT 6-8, class 12:45-7pm

W: Gym 7:10-8:25, class 9:10-10:00, work 11-4, rotc 5:15-9:30pm

TH: PT 6-7, class 12:45-3:30pm, ROTC 4-5, group run 6:30-7:30

F: class 9:10-10:00, gym 10:15-11:15, run 

I go to sleep at 9pm most nights and wake up around 6am. I run 4x per week and weight train 3x per week (I'm prepping for a Half Marathon). My job in ROTC is very time consuming as well I can't represent that in this schedule. Tuesdays between PT and class is when I'm doing hw or preping for ROTC stuff.

I am a 21 y/o college student who has a very busy life between, school, work, ROTC, fitness, and social life. This semester, I am packed with stuff every Tuesday and Wednesday (it's a mix between ROTC responsibilities, work, and school). After these two days, I wake up on Thursday feeling mentally exhausted but I still need to get some of the school work I have done. I have a weekly group run I do on Thursday nights that I used to always look forward to but now I find myself getting to the run and not wanting to do it, but afterward, I feel amazing so I'm always glad I did it. 

I had a test on Friday this week that I didn't prepare the best for (due to my crazy T+W then coupled with low motivation to get stuff done on TH) and I don't know what happened but I got in there and just told myself I couldn't do it. My distress was very obvious to the teacher and I turned in my test after only 20minutes with not even half of it filled out. He tried asking if I was okay but I ran away and cried in another classroom. I wish I would've talked to him about how I was feeling and I'm going to talk to him on Monday.

around August or September last year I went on a mission to stop eating processed suger of any kind cold turkey. 
Within about 2 weeks of starting was the worst,craving was sky high I was getting withdrawal headaches and even feeling sick...but I pushed through. eventually I reached a point where my cravings went away! I lost about 15 pounds,lost brain fog and genuinely felt more optimistic of life.....even though there was nothing look forward to in my life😐
one thing I hadn't realized is that from August/September till late January 
is that not only had I not had a migraine, I hadn't even had a regular headache 
which is shocking because I get around 6- 7 migraines a month.
now at the beginning of this month,there were alot of birthdays and crap
and I decided freak it let me let loose alittle with my loved ones....and it sorta spiraled after that
I've been eating suger for like 2 to 3 weeks now
and I haven't been binging or stuffing my face with as much suger as I can
I've been eating moderately 
a slice of cake today,a candy bar tomorrow you know
and through all this.....guess what made its great comeback....oh yea baby!! my migraines,I've had 2 migraines this month alone at the time of writing this post thats only a period of 2 days! 
it was further confirmed by yours truly as I ate suger last night and woke up right at this moment....while writing this post have a headache....I don't think I've ever been excited about having a headache lol
so I'm not saying that not eating suger is a cure for migraines and this discovery may just be 1 part of it I honestly don't know
 but if you've tried everything...this could be something you might want to look into
just beware of the first 2 weeks will be hell!
your suger cravings will be insane 
lots of headaches,you WILL feel sick etc
but after that it'll be smooth sailing

I graduated from university one and a half years ago with a degree in translational studies. It's not difficult to find a job in that field, but they mostly don't pay well and with the rise of AI I also don't see much of a future in that field. While I was writing my thesis, I had daily anxiety attacks about my future and felt very unsure about what to do. So instead of going straight for a master's, I decided to try some things out and did a couple of paid internships, which made me feel better momentarily but didn't really fix anything long-term. 

Then, in summer, I decided I'd go back to uni to get a teaching degree. I could truly imagine liking being a teacher, but at the same time it feels like I'm just taking the safe route. I am also bothered by being the age that I am and still being in the same position I was in when I was 19 and if I'm being honest, I don't find the programme as intellectually stimulating as I would like. In addition to that, I am beginning to worry if only starting to properly work at around 29 (the degree takes 3 1/2 years of theory and 2 years of practice where you get half the salary), I might also have to say goodbye to my dreams of a family and a house.

But the truth is, I don't have better alternatives either. The only thing I  know is that I want to have an job that requires me to think and that I can't do entirely from home. Other than that, all I want is to be surrounded by beauty and tranquility, but that's not exactly something one can write in a cover letter 😅

Hello, my server was recently raided wherein someone spammed gore and pinged a bunch of people that were online. I'm the only admin on the server, and we've around 4,500 members. This user joined 2 weeks ago through a link on Reddit, I think.

Anyway, I would like to write an announcement apologizing for what occurred but I'm not very good at words. It's supposed to be a server for students of philosophy, and I feel like I've made a huge blunder and have a great burden, so I would like to make it a bit semi-professional. Any advice?

I just don't want them to be mad at me, think I'm incompetent, if it's not a good enough message. The issue is that I don't know anyone on the server whom I can trust with moderator permissions, so I don't know in what way I'm ”working on moderation systems.” I'm the only admin there. What can I also write saying what I'm going to do to prevent it from happening again?

A format like this is good right?

&gt;\- Brief recap of what happened  
\- Apology  
\- Acknowledge any emotional damage that the gore caused  
\- What I'm going to implement to prevent it happening again

(Excluding playing video games, because there's no education path to becoming a Twitch streamer and it's mostly luck).

The first is lawyer. I'm very passionate about legal issues. I love reading about them. The reason I'm not eager to pursue a career in this path is the education requirement is intensive, so if I decide after 12 months at a law firm that I hate the legal field, I'm out much more money than the other two options.

Aside from law, I'm passionate about weather and numbers. I'm passionate about weather because I've always loved weather, the way climates work is very interesting to me. I'm especially passionate about tornadoes. Tornadoes fascinate me. It is perhaps the most physical manifestation of an extreme weather event on the planet, barring volcanoes. 

For accounting, it's a bit different. I've hated math since I was in elementary school. If I were to actually move on community college instead of procrastinating, I'd feel most comfortable taking a remedial math course because I don't think I remembered any math concepts beyond basic fractions and algebra.

But I love *working with* numbers. I love adding things, sorting amounts from lowest to highest, analyzing the percentage change between different values, etc. Working with numbers has a soothing effect on me, so long as it's not some sort of ""solve for X"" bullshit. I work with numbers on my free time for fun. I did a project where I looked at 5 years worth of my own credit card statements, and separated the purchases into specific categories, and ranked the categories in various ways. I compared the difference between one year's fast food spending and another year's fast food spending. I had plenty of other things to do, I could've played Call of Duty or GTA V. But I spent around 10 hours compiling a full analysis of my spending habits across 5 years of credit card purchases purely for fun - and I loved every minute of it.

Both of these passions present issues. For one, I have no real interest to become a weatherman/woman. I don't think I do well under pressure, and being on camera even in a small town sounds like a nightmare. I just want to learn more about weather.

I hate math. If I can't figure out something on a calculator, I don't want to bother. But I absolutely love working with and analyzing numbers. 

I don't know enough about either of the real-world applications for these passions in careers dictated by meteorology and accounting degrees at college to decide whether I should bank the rest of my life on them. All I know is what I enjoy, what I'm passionate about. I have no idea how to turn it into a career or marketable skill, or whether I'd still enjoy it if I did.

In other words, I have a few avenues to pursue but I'm filled with doubt over whether I should actually pursue them. These career paths cost money, after all, and I'm terrified that I will waste tuition on something I throw away almost immediately.

For the past 5 years I have been doing semi-professional gaming, it was definitely my passion in life but I never seemed to break the final barrier into professional gaming, this was primarily due to being addicted to drugs, and being openly extremely depressed. I burned every bridge to pro that I had developed and as I've gotten older the hype around my identity has died down and honestly I've just gotten worse as a player all together.   


In the game I play there is a collegiate route that players in my situation will often utilize when they're done with attempting to go pro or if they're an ex-pro and the benefit of playing collegiate is you're given a full-ride scholarship, I tried this with two schools and although academically I was fine I absolutely hated it, watching all of my peers and friends making 6 figures playing a game while I'm stuck in collegiate took a major toll on my ego which resulted in me dropping out and not looking back. (I've only completed one semester of transferrable credits)

Currently, I dont have much life experience and I feel awful about it, I feel as if I'm 17 or 18 in terms of life experience because I sheltered myself in this video game for years.

I sit here with 0 savings, and i'm starting a dead-end factory job next week with no plans for my future or no direction. I genuinely do not see a path for me to succeed in life or find my own happiness and it hurts.

 I've started to workout and eat healthier which has improved my quality of life a bit, but I still live in the past of being so close to achieving my dream and falling down with nothing to show for it.

Frankly, I do not know what came over me or WHY in God's name I decided to lie. I thought that I'd dropped my ""compulsive"" lying habit a long time ago, but clearly not.

Which is where I am stuck. Do I confess to her and tell her I lied, that it was a stupid thing for me to do, and hope that our friendship isn't wrecked by it? Or do I wait it out until I turn 18 and move on as if nothing happened?

My friend is super chill, so I don't think telling her would totally jeopardize our friendship. I know 17-18 is only a one-year age gap, but I feel really guilty and fake right now and I'm just very unsure of what to do. I just want some insight and opinions on the topic, advice and whatnot.

I'm so worried this is going to continue into my 30's and if I something doesn't change, I don't know what I'll do. 

I did everything right. Or so I had thought. I went out and got a good job (trades), did all my trade schooling, bought a small town house at 20. Made decent money, could afford it all. Never carried debt besides the house. Life circumstances has now caused me to become in debt and I'm still making about as much as I was 5 years ago. Calculating it out, if EVERYTHING goes according to plan with NO unexpected expenses, I can be out of debt in 15 months.

Going back to school now feels like massive steps backwards. Keeping or selling the house feels like a lose lose situation. I either keep it and continue paying the mortgage or sell the place and pay someone else's mortgage. My place is too small to rent out a room even if I wanted to. It has worked to live with like girlfriends, but I think with a tenant it would be awful. 

I have the same group of guy friends I have had since 14. I really feel like I don't connect with them anymore. No one wants to do anything it seems. Most of them now have girlfriends (I literally broke up with mine and then 3 of them got girlfriends lol what are the chances). None of us have kids. It feels like I have to initiate hanging out all the time. And when I first go to meet up I feel stoked I'm hanging out with people and then not an hour later, it just feels boring. 

I literally think I'm broken because I have such a hard time trying to even figure out how I could make new friends. I feel like a house cat that has never gone out of the house and I'm just standing looking out an open door at a world that I could go and explore, but choose to go back to bed instead because I can't figure out what to do once I'm outside. Like I actually don't know how to make friends. I feel like I need new hobbies because that's what is always recommended. Like my half hobby is my car. I say half hobby because of money. If I had more money to spend on it, I would be in the garage constantly doing something to it or having multiple cars, but now I have this debt. I don't know what I can do with no money and no current social hobbies. Over the last 10 years my confidence and optimism for the future has just diminished.

There is only a handful of things I want out of life. I want to live somewhere warm, I don't want to be hindered by money (like I don't need to be rich, but I don't want replacing a washing machine devouring every dollar I have), and I want a good group of friends. Like actual fun, caring people. People I enjoy being around. I feel like these are all things I will never get. 

I feel this post is all over the fucking place, but it's just things whirling around in my head like crazy. I think it's making me crazy. If I could add a venting flair I would, but there wasn't one.

Anyways, I've been trying to turn my life around for quite a while. Years, in fact. I seemed to be successful for awhile, and then COVID hit. I lost my job, I gained 100lbs (now over 400lbs), and have just been caught in the worst bout of depression in my life. My driver's license was suspended for driving without insurance (couldn't afford it at the time) so I have no transportation and it has an $8,000 lean on it to get it cleared. 

I tried for 2 full years while on unemployment to try and find a job but received 0 calls after hundreds of job applications. I finally got a call from a fast food place next to my house and I make $800 a month. I'm weeks behind on rent, I owe money to my friend that I had to borrow to pay rent before. I live in Texas, so the government has no resources for single males. I get $30 of food stamps and don't qualify for medicaid. I have bad knees and a bad back from injuries when I was young and it keeps me in pain constantly.

I need to see a psychiatrist but I can't even get close to affording it. Every time I try to change something, I can't escape the feeling that the effort that I put in doesn't matter. It feels like every mistake I've ever made is just a huge weight that's constantly on my chest. I can barely get out of bed in the morning. I sometimes feel like I can't even breath because the weight is so heavy.  


I've spent so much time on the internet just looking for an answer but there's just nothing I've read that's clicked.

Hi I’m (F26) and my boyfriend is (M29) we met when I was 14 he was 17. When we first met we would have sex about 3/2 times a day or every chance we would get (I lost my virginity to him) but that lasted about 8 months then I saw a huge shift he did not want to have sex at all !!! I would throw myself at him and  nothing. It started with, im so tired, I don’t feel good, I have diarrhea, then it got worse and worse, I would go to sleep in full nude and he would get upset saying I’m so desperate and that I need help because that’s all I think about, he would accuse me of just using him for sex and I truly did think it was me for a while, at that point we would have sex once a month.  I would literally cry when we would finally have sex because it was so rare it was the only time I felt loved which idk if that’s normal or healthy but it is what it is that how I felt at the time. This continued to happen from when I was 16-23 that’s when our sex life was horrible !!! I hated it I felt so ugly and unattractive and he’s not very affectionate at all which is why sec was important because I got hugged and kissed ect… so I have been neglected a lot emotionally but I would brush it off as “ I have to respect his choice” in the movies you always see the girlfriend or wife saying she’s tired or not in the mood so I thought it would be fair if the roles would be reversed, I thought that maybe he just had issues. I had thought about him cheating but never found anything. So when I was 24 I started to heal from past trama and I opened up to him about me being molested when I was younger and days after my confession he confessed to me that he was raped when he was 8 years old by someone at his school I obviously broke down crying and didn’t push to get more info out I just followed his lead with opening up. So that when I started to think what if he’s gay ?

I'm hoping I'm posting this in the right place. Last year I (33f) fell pregnant while working a full time job as a retail manager and decided to drop back to part time work throughout my pregnancy and begin part time study. My partner (30m) works full time as a nurse. I managed to push through my first year of study despite having a new born and passed my subjects, but this year I am struggling hard. I'm in my first term back, bub is now almost 8 months old and I've had to return to work 15 hours a week to help bring in some extra money. 

To say I am stressed/exhausted is an understatement. We unfortunately do not have a lot of family to support us with childcare and my partner refuses to pay for childcare or a sitter, as he thinks it makes my returning to work pointless. He also doesn't want me to return to my retail job as it doesn't pay well enough, but I feel without finishing my qualification I won't find a higher paying job, and I've been with this company 10 years and know they will work around me as much as I need. 
The problem for me is I have someone to care for bub the one day during the week I work and one of my night classes, but then have to somehow find the extra 15-20 hours a week to study and complete assignments while also looking after bub during the week. My partner looks after bub the one day on the weekend I work. 
I have suggested to my partner that I defer my studies for 12 months until bub is older so I can work more and reduce the financial stress, while also having more time and attention for the house and to take baby to playgroups etc. My partner thinks I should drop the work and finish my study, not seeming to understand the extra hours the study requires or attention it takes away from bub attending groups receiving engagement from me during the day.

I want to get a degree in something so I can find a decent paying job and contribute to society. I can't work somewhere that doesn't have good insurance due to my disability, so a degree may be required.

My local college doesn't have a computer science program, but they do have a business program (Something I'm somewhat passionate about). The two colleges near by have computer science programs, but my anxiety affects my driving. I can do it, but it's a little difficult.

What I want to know is the following

1. Is it worth taking general ed courses in my local college, math courses, and whatever else that would go towards a computer science degree (??) and transfer to one of the other colleges near here? Or should I just bite the bullet and go to one with a computer science program right away even though I have no college credits
2. Should I try to get various certifications that are compsci related (A+, Networking, etc.) and try to find a job that way? I know my way around hardware, but it's not really my passion.

I'm at a loss as to what to do. I'm tired of being on disability, but I literally can not survive without the insurance it provides.

HELLO EVERYONE
I am a 21 year old male who’s been dating my girlfriend (also 21) for 8 months now. We first started as a normal hookup and about 2 months later became official. The last couple months she has had a very low sex drive (Libido) and seems to use excuses often. As of right now we haven’t had sex in 3 weeks, and before that it was around once a week for the past few months. so I brought it up to her the other night because I couldn’t take it anymore. She is an honest person and never has had an issue with being honest with me - when I asked what was going on she said that “her low libido isn’t being caused by me (the boyfriend) or anything that I’m doing fundamentally wrong, she said that she just has never really cared much for sex in general and while she agrees that when we have sex it’s good sex, she doesn’t feel bothered by not having sex often” (once every 2-4 weeks) She said that when we used to have sex more often she felt bad turning me down, but now that she’s more comfortable with me that she feels like she can be honest with me. I’m coming to Reddit for advice on if this is something that I should break up with her for or it’s just something that I should learn to accept if that is how she truly feels about sex?

Hey Everyone.Apologies for how long this is going to be.

So, I come from an upper-middle class family. My dad is running quite a successful retail business for the city we live in and has made a name for himself in his industry. And he did all this from the ground-up. So amidst the kids of the school I went to, I used to be one of the ""rich"" kids but my parents never let me get the idea. I NEVER had to struggle for anything. Anything that had to be done, we had servants for it. If I needed stationery or something to eat or needed to go somewhere or anything like that, some worker would be instructed to take care of that. Other kids had to get all this done themselves. At the time I had no idea about the toll it would take on me later on in life. As a result of all this, I gained no street knowledge, no information about the adversities of the real world, no smartness. I just used to feel privileged (which I was, btw).

I graduated high school with average grades, got into an average college, erolled in an average computer application program and then things started to go downhill. I lost all motivation to work hard. My attitude got too casual because in the back of my mind I always knew, no one was relying on me, I can always fallback on my parents and they will handle all the consequences of my carelessness. Although I was beginning to realize that my parents' money is not gonna help me much after I'm done with college, still I didn't do shit about it. I had no aim after college. No ambitions. I barely worked on anything ever. Never participated in anything. Had no interest in socializing except with my 3 good friends. Just before my last sem was gonna begin, Covid showed up and we graduated college sitting at home. Spent good 5-6 months at home. And as the lockdown lifted, my parents asked me if there's something I had in mind for myself. If not, they suggested that I join them. So I agreed.

Now, I'm 22. Its been 2 yrs since I joined my dad's business, and I feel I am having a super tough time learning how the everything works. I have absolutely zero networking and communication skills (2 of the most crucial skills required for business). I still am not sure if this is what I wanna do but what other choice do I have? I have no skills. I find it really difficult understanding basic stuff(which had never been a problem when I was younger). I am unable to think about any new/fresh ideas to grow the business. I can't have a say in important business decisions. My money management skills suck big time. When I'm at the store, I can't find much work to do so sometimes I'm just sitting idle. I feel I'm just making a fool of myself in front of the other workers and I might just ruin my brand's name. I put off important tasks for later. I take frequent breaks even though I don't work as hard. And the thought that someday I might have to run everything here and be in the place of my dad seems so intimidating and overwhelming. Everyday I wake up miserable thinking about going to work. I don't treat it as my business, I just work as if I'm an employee there, and that too an incompetent one.

I will be super grateful if somebody could suggest some tips on how I could get better because I think I'm gonna collapse soon.

Thanks for taking the time.

I (25m) have settled on cutting my family in their entirety once and for all. This comes after a long history of mental abuse and childhood trauma that I have tried my best to process without the help of therapy, but as a result has left me with a very apathetic and “it is what it is” outlook on life.

The final “nail in the coffin” so to speak happened a few days ago. A good friend of mine (27m) who has a younger brother (21m) has always been very close with my younger brother (21m) and have always been seen as a duo for trouble. A few months ago, the terrible two got into some rather intense legal trouble since they both committed a rather bad crime together. This led to my friends brother to “narc” on my brother, whereas my brother kept quiet.

My family have, and consistently continue to have a very “anti police” and “anti authority” outlook. In plain terms, they live a “ghetto” life. No respect for authority and “all police lovers deserve to be killed”. I am cut from a very different cloth to them and understand life’s great rule - play stupid games, and win stupid prizes. I’ve never had issues with authority, and spoke as I’m spoken to. I understand that police are just doing their job, and if you don’t want to be arrested, don’t commit crime.

My friends family have never mistreated me, have clothed me, fed me, and given me shelter when my family wouldn’t. As a result, regardless of whether my friends brother “opened his mouth”, I understand that I no longer need to like him, but out of respect for my friend, I still remain civil with his brother and his family. I do not represent my family, nor does my friend represent his. It is a mutual understanding that we both share. I still have my friend and his family visit quite regularly, whereas my family doesn’t come anywhere near me because of this fact.

This all come to fruition a few days ago when my friend and his family were visiting. Because I live locally to my family, they are aware of these visits, and for lack of a better word “keep tabs” on who is at my home. they decided it was in their best interest to pay me a visit while my friend was here with his family to “exact revenge” because of their ghetto mentality. This erupted into a screaming war of me kicking everyone out of my home, making a mockery out of myself in front of the entire neighborhood as I screamed the street down.

After composing myself and processing my anger, I decided that it was in my best interest to cut off my entire family, and sent them a mature and composed message with my reasons. The message, of course was responded with a load of “you don’t understand family loyalty” and “you’re sticking up for people who deserve to be put down”.

Over the years, my family have stolen from my home, guilt tripped me, and disapproved of every positive influence within my life. I have kept my silence and said time and time again “it is what it is. They are family.”

I am starting to feel a sense of guilt within my decision. I am in charge of my entire family’s paperwork, emails, appointment dates, etc. I keep track of their lives for them, and without my constant reminders there is every chance they could lose their social security income, which is their only source.

Over the last few days, my family have been messaging my friends and other members of the family and bringing more and more abuse to me and my home. This has had a VERY heavy strain on my mental state and general wellbeing and I am at a loss of what to do.

I want to move away as far as I can where nobody can find me and enjoy peace within myself, but the problem is that is just not a possibility. I have no job, I have no driver's license, and no savings. I do a bit of freelancing things on the side that helps bring in some money, but nothing absolutely groundbreaking that would allow me to just up and move tomorrow. My family live locally to me, and because they know they can no longer get through to me, they have resorted to messaging others, who in turn message me, essentially getting people to do their dirty work for them.

I have deactivated social media, but obviously phone numbers are being given out and once again it just circles around. I don't exactly want to go to the police about the event and would rather deal with it myself without resorting to ""lowering to their level"" or pettiness. I am above that, and I know I am.

I don’t know why but I feel like it hurts me more now than it did when it was happening 8 years ago. 

I think about how everyone called me homophobic slurs (even though I’m not a lesbian— but even if I was, why did it matter?), and girls would go around telling people that I made them uncomfortable by looking at them in the change rooms while they changed (I wasn’t, and frankly it’s narcissistic to even think that I was). if I sat next to anyone in gym class they would get up and go sit next to someone else and give me this look as if they were creeped out by me. One time our gym teacher even sat us down and talked about bullying, because she said she had noticed some mean behaviour going on in the class to the point where she spent two entire days talking about it, sitting on the ground in the gym instead of doing gym. I wondered at the time who she was talking about, because I was so naive to how people treated me that I didn’t even notice. 

There was a party once that I decided to go to because I wanted to feel like I fit in and I ended up leaving early because there wasn’t a single person there who wanted to talk to me or socialize and I was completely alone. I went up to one girl and I asked her if she wanted to hang out sometime or be friends and exchange numbers and she gave me this dirty look and said no. I wasn’t hitting on her, I was just trying to make a friend. There was another girl standing next to her who was very conservative (the most hick girl I’ve ever seen, she often came to school wearing what they wear in duck dynasty), and she gave me this look of pure disgust. Someone told me later that this particular girl is very homophobic and ‘fucking hates gays’ and then it suddenly made sense why she gave me a look of pure hatred every time I happened to walk past her in the hallways. 

It’s so upsetting and I find myself getting more triggered about it now than I ever have before, because at the time I didn’t realize this was actual homophobia and people treated me this way out of their own distaste for gay people. I feel like I’ve been discriminated against throughout my life and I didn’t even realize it, and it’s taken a big toll on me down the line because I feel like I am inherently unlikeable/ unloveable. 

I recently ran into someone (a male) who I went to high school with and he asked me if I was still dating ‘that girl’. I said no, and that I’ve never dated a girl, and he goes, ‘wait you’re a lesbian right?’ I said no …. And he was genuinely puzzled, as if it was common knowledge that I was. I also started hanging out with someone who went to a nearby school, and she told me one of her friends told her I was a lesbian too…. Like…. Why was everyone discussing my sexuality ? Why was everyone acting like they knew more about my sexuality than I did ? Hearing these things now, it just makes me feel so much worse. It makes me feel like I need to prove that I’m not gay just to receive a little bit of respect from people, and that’s a really fucked up feeling.

I have no idea what to do. 
Back Story - I was raised by my grandpa, and he adopted me so i now see him as my dad. When i was younger, me and my grandma and grandpa would go to this restaurant every sunday and my grandma became friends with a waitress there. After my grandpa passed (i was 9 at the time she did) me and my grandpa still went every sunday. 
the older i got i found out my grandpa was giving this lady money. long story short he was paying for her car and rent and etc. He always verify would tell me but never really brought it up. I never liked the lady. never knew her either. 
Anyway, i went to beauty school right after i graduated highschool. One day my grandpa called me and said she was living at the house. I was furious. this was 2018. Now i moved back home in 2019 and she was still there. She tried to justify why she was there and i told her she shouldn’t be taking all of my grandpas money and using him. and ever since me and her have always fought and she always degraded me. anyway. 
This lady has 2 dogs, 1 horse. She doesn’t pay my grandpa any rent or anything. she always asks for money. the last year he has stopped giving her $. I moved out beginning of 2021 because she would always yell and curse at me and say awful things to me and leave notes on my room door. my grandpa has given her everything he has had even let her have his only car. Now i have had to step in and pay for things since she yells at him to give her money. 
The past several months, my grandpa talked how he wants her to leave. She was only supposed to live until she got back on her feet. it’s been years now. She goes to work and makes my grandpa take car of her animals. He is now 94 years old. he is pretty independent but still. He told me he wants to get authorized or an eviction notice to get her out. She keeps telling him she is not leaving. How do i go about this? i have no idea what to do. Everytime i’m around her i have panic attacks and she always fights with me or says something to me. it tears our family apart aswell since no one wants to come visit my grandpa.

I have money now and an amazing job… on the other side of the continent. No family or friends or fun to be seen. Work, gym, then sleep enough to work and gym. Trying snowboarding but it’s still not scratching the itch. 

I have no idea what to do, I feel like I’m missing out on life but I can’t just not have income then work until I’m fucking 70. I’ll kill myself if I’m still working at 50… even 40. I fucking hate work. It’s so… redundant.

Like do I need to go back to working at a bar or something? So I can meet people to do enjoy life with. Go back to my hometown and do fuck all again? But be with my aging family.

(24yo f, married, living out of home, no kids). 

I am currently at a stage where I essentially have two clear-cut paths to chose from- either 

a) continue full-time nursing, create an art portfolio on the side and finish a media arts degree part-time 

or,

b) Give my all to the media arts degree and creating a portfolio, while working casually as a nurse.

Background in terms of Nursing:- Completed bachelor's degree, 1 year of rural hospital experience and a graduate certificate in a nursing speciality. Moved from rural place back to home town/city and currently jobless with an offer pending my acceptance.

\-Currently did a job interview in the middle of a very stressful time in my life to ""safe-cushion"" myself, not having any concrete plans at the time because I was sort of floating in a stress void...and somehow secured a full-time position at a hospital which I can say yes or no to at the moment.

Background in terms of Art:- Natural desire to create all the time, had art lessons since 4yo... encouraged by parents to only ever pursue it as a hobby, never a career choice, which I always struggled with, but that's another topic.

\- Took up a 3-year media arts degree focusing on animation, film and sound design, which I completed 1.5 years of and really loved it, changed mid-way to bachelor of nursing out of fear during another stressful time in my life revolving around an unstable home environment due to parental behaviour, where job security really seemed like a great idea.

\- Painted murals, helped with designing book covers, did little films while studying nursing, but no official ""job experience"" or impressive portfolio to show for it.

\- Mid way through first nursing job re-applied to the same media arts degree, created another art portfolio specifically for the application and by some miracle got back into the degree. Now I am enrolled into a full time media arts degree which will take me 1.5 years to complete if I decide to stick with full time.

Personal/Financial Situation:

\-Living out of home with parter since 20yo, married for the past 4 years, very supportive relationship.

\-Husband makes enough income for me to be working casually or part-time, however I can't shake the feeling of being a burden but that's more a ""me"" problem, because he says he doesn't mind and just wants me to be happy.

\- Recently lost my father, leaving my immigrant mother and younger brother and grandmother highly dependent on my partner and myself for emotional, financial, and all sorts of support, making the financial situation a bit more tight for the time being, which also adds to my feeling of being a ""burden"" on my husband if I were to pursue uni full time with casual employment right now instead of full time employment, although that was the initial plan before all this happened. Part of feeling like a burden is because all the problems are coming from my side of the family and I feel like I should be responsible in helping more with finances in that case with the full time job.

I know essentially it is my decision, but would appreciate some opinions/advice. Don't mind if it's harsh.

Thanks everyone

I haven't made many posts on this site, so forgive me for any formatting errors. I (19f) have lived with my mother for most of my life. It was not a happy childhood. I have a working theory that she is some form of a narcissist. From the age of 12, my sister and I were made to do all the chores in the home, including laundry, dishes, cooking, and upkeep of the house. No one else even picked up after themselves. If there was a mess, it was our job to clean it. If we didn't cook, it was because Mom brought home soup from the dollar store in cans for us to microwave. If the sexism wasn't obvious, she always favored our youngest brother. YB (youngest brother) always got the most Xmas gifts and the most expensive ones. He had no chores and was allowed to backtalk her to the point of straight-up insulting her with no consequences, while if any of the rest of us made eye contact the wrong way we would be grounded for a week, much less smarted off. YB never had a screen time limit and was allowed a TV in his bedroom, while the rest of us were made to put all of our electronics in the living room at 7 pm every night. This rule stood until I was 18 and left the house. It also stands to reason that since he was not made to put his things away that our 10 pm bedtime did not apply to him either.  Mom spent the majority of my life policing my clothes and my body and on several occasions (rare but never forgotten) she called both mine and my sister's bodies disgusting. She aggressively policed my dating life and would restrict my phone privileges when she was mad at me specifically to cut me off from whoever I was dating. I was never allowed to leave the house. When I was on dates, she made sure to tell me she would know exactly where I was and if I had sex there would be hell to pay. Every date I ever went on I spent the entire time shaking with anxiety and feeling like I needed to throw up. In fact, on one occasion she thought I did have sex and I was dragged into the gynecologist's office to have a ""virginity check"" performed. Luckily for me, that's not a real thing. And even if they did, a hymen is not definitive proof of virginity. That thing can break during intensive exercise. I don't know what she thought they were going to do, strap me to a table and force the exam? What kind of loving mother wants that? What kind of mother is so obsessed with her child's sexual status she forces them to have an invasive exam? When I turned 18, I finally left to go to college. While I was here, I met my boyfriend (20m), and we've been together for about 6 months now. I was happier than ever since I finally got away from her, but occasionally I would get texts from her scolding me for one thing or another and it would ruin my entire night. On dates with my boyfriend, I would feel this irrational fear that when I looked over my shoulder she would be there. And at this point, I knew when the semester was over I could not go back home, right back under her control as her emotional punching bag housemaid. And I refused to subject my BF to her restricting our time together whenever she decided I'd gotten too mouthy. The time came to fill out the FAFSA  again, and I no longer want to be reliant on my mother for anything. Any money she spends is an excuse for her to berate me over my grades, which she did when I was younger too. I was sent crying to many a teacher in high school and told to beg for extra credit (often for grades like C's or B-'s) or I would be grounded for a month. If I had a bad grade on a report card I would have a meltdown all the way home on the bus. Any money she spends is another excuse for her to have any sort of control over me. There are only two ways to be able to file the FAFSA independently. I have to be over the age of 24, OR I have to be married. My BF and I have had several long discussions about this. We are pretty serious about each other, but we have agreed that if we have to, this is something we would be willing to do (with a pre- or postnup) to get me away from my mother. We've agreed that we wouldn't consider this an actual binding agreement between the two of us to be husband and wife, due to the short time we've been dating, but that it would be more like a contract of convenience. He does, however, talk all the time about getting married eventually and having a nice proper wedding and not the courthouse ordeal that will have to happen for this to work. If we go through with this, my already cheap tuition would be even cheaper, meaning it would be perfectly manageable for the two of us to cover it easily, or even me alone. And best of all, I could escape my mother. So, I've come here to see what anyone's thoughts on the matter might be.

So I finally found the confidence I've been looking for my whole life at 28 years old, but it came at the expense of a bad relationship (it was my 1st) and I was terrible without going into full detail about the relationship, I was insecure, kinda immature about some things, kept comparing myself to other dudes etc., only to come to the realization that all I had to do was stay focused on myself and she would of been along with the program. We broke up once and go back together, and things didn't get any better and it ended up being a whole 2 years of wasted time and that's the 1 thing that eat at me (mainly because I feel like did most of the wasting), but I try not to dwell. Since day 1 she was waiting on me to become the man I needed to be, she even told me I would be every woman dream if had it at least 70% together (which not literally but I get the point). Im fully over that person now, been single for some months and moved on but I made this post mainly about my confidence. I'm happier, about to get in the best shape of my life, working 2 full time jobs and a side hustle but my question is why did it have to come this way, especially at someone else's expense? I guess it's called life but damn talk about embarrassing 🤦🏾‍♂️. 

Also I dealt with a great deal of trauma from my childhood past from being a sheltered kid that I didn't realize and even though I had both parents in the home they were mentally ill because their traumas that they still to this day never realized ( they meant well, just a lot things they didn't know), and I finally found out all of my ""why me"" questions. And I did it all without a therapist. Because of this though, I used to want a family and marriage but now I'm considering not even having kids nor marriage at all because I'm just afraid any kid I would have I missed out on so much in the past and I want a mature fun and lit life. I'm even considering getting a vasectomy. 

I'm solely focused on myself right now becoming the great man I know I'm potentially capable of being. I don't have it all figured out just yet, I'll just leave it up to God, but I'm noticeably better than I've ever been my entire life and it's refreshing even though I'm still a working progress.

I had planned if things went wrong, I knew I could ""make it by""... but I knew it would be tough. Anyways, not 6 months into the new home, and we split. Thats said and done, and I do not miss her...lol. But previous to her I lived very modestly, had a decent savings, had enough money to buy what I wanted to eat/drink when the mood arises.

I've now been living alone here for a year. I love this property and home. It's definitely my dream home. But I feel like life is on hold. I'm scraping by, just barely, sometimes running a monthly deficit (heating costs in winter for example). I can't afford to go out and date, or enjoy my hobbies. I do everything I possibly can to reduce monthly expenses. (And I'm pretty damn good at it... I've lived very very poor before, and learned to make the best of it). I'm 38 now, have a good job, but feel like a broke ass 18 year old. I know it all goes back to I thought I was starting a family, and with two incomes, it was more than comfortable financially. 

How long do I suffer... how long do I tell my friends I can't go anywhere, or do anything because I can't afford it? How long do I blow off family cause I can't afford to travel there. I bought this place to have room for us, and my things... I've sold all my things. This place is empty. I've tried to budget and plan things out, and I think in about another year I'll be in a better position slightly... but not by  a whole hell of a lot. 

I know this is all my fault, and hence my willingness to ""tough"" through it.... but damn sometimes I wanna give up. Where I work, everyone except me is within 3-5 years of retirement... they hired me to ""improve things"".... but they are so scared of change, I'm basically forced to give up any good ideas, and just comply... or fight a losing fight.

Prices on everything have gone up, I've given up my health for cheaper food. I talk to locals who can't even find people to work. It seems like folks around me living off unemployment and assistance literally have way more expendable income... food cards, and now free crack pipes... wtf!?

There are a lot of personal things we both need to work through before we can truly be happy together. 
My issue is we live in a city neither of us would like to stay in. He has to because of personal and work obligations, but my only real set back in moving is my husband. I have the option to move to another state to live with my grandma and mom or to stay here and get my own apartment, both are achievable. 
The issue with staying here is the possibility of continually running into my husband and not having true separation. But this will allow us to be close and hopefully work on the marriage. It’s just emotionally difficult. If I move with my grandma and mom I will be in a much more “relaxing” environment and able to separate myself from the situation to work on my self. BUT….. there is so much personal drama between my mom and grandma. My mother is a recovering addict and my grandmother is a gaslighting narcissist. I know how to handle my grandmother alone. But I’m not to sure how I will be able to handle both of them together.
On top of everything I may be losing my CDL because I was randomly selected for a DOT drug test just 2 days after I smoked weed one weekend. Because of how stressed I have been with this whole situation. I haven’t smoked in over 2years  so I feel like the universe is trying to get me to leave here. 
I am just so lost right now and need advice.

I know that with their help, I could really achieve all I want in my life, as they are both extremely academic people. I could start eating better, live in a better environment, I could have things like the gym, housing, books, classes paid for if I went to live with them. But my fear of moving on from my father is stopping me.  


When I was around 12 years old my mother passed away, leaving me, my dad, and my brother by ourselves. He's been my rock for these last few years and he has told me many times that he depends on me as I depend on him for emotional support. This is the main thing that scares me, my father was a functional alcoholic and a very heavy smoker. And recently he has supposedly beaten these addictions. He spends more time inside with me and my brother, and I haven't seen him indulging in these harmful activities for a while, but I'm afraid that if I leave (especially to go live with my grandparents) then he'll drink himself into the grave, but I want to make sure that this is clear NEVER has he hit me or my brother, and I have no worry for the safety of my little brother should I leave. As these are my mother's parents, he is worried that they are trying to take me away from him. And I understand where he is coming from, as they have asked me on more than one occasion to emancipate from him. And when they do that it tears my heart apart.  


I want so badly to become an emotional trauma therapist because it's my goal to one day be able to help him through these emotions. But part of me knows that if I stay here then I'll never reach that goal. But at the same time, I know that he might start to kill himself again if I leave. I've already lost my mother and I can't afford to lose him too. My brother can't afford to lose him.   


I know if I stay here I won't receive the help I need for school, and this seems like a pretty straightforward decision, and I know that if my mom were still here I'd take it without hesitation, he needs that support. But she died five years ago, and as far as I know, he's not dating anymore. I don't know if he ever will again. But I know it helps him to know that I'm there for him.   


The college is only a few hours upstate, I could come back almost every weekend to see him if I really wanted to. But even still I think that he'd be too upset to understand that.

BUT bear with me!
I will start off by saying that this is not a ""religion"" that will worship any higher being. I also what to state that this ""religion"" should not be taken as a literal religion, I just want to provide a community that gives the same feeling of unity as a church can. I simply want to make a community that lays down some basic moral guidelines to help guide individuals who dont feel that they belong in any formal religions. As well as a place where people can come to discuss moral dilemmas, life's questions, vent about problems that other people may have experience with and literally anything else. Not to be a place for nihilists to gather and hate life together. But for people to be able to come to peace with the idea that the afterlife is probably peaceful nothingness and that they can still live a ""Meaningful"" and ""Fufilling"" life that's not depending on social expectations and without the hard guidelines that some religions enforce.

These ""rules"" will typically, but not always, conform to what present society deems right and wrong. The basis of the Moral code of this ""religion"" will be that although life is essentially meaningless we should still strive to make the world a better place through positivity and good deeds small and big. We will enforce that you spend your life doing whatever makes you happy so long that it does not negatively affect another person in any direct way. Now, with this idea being seen as a very libertarian view along with following the ideals of MANY other religions, I don't want it to be compared. My goal is more or less to form a community free of judgement for people to come and discuss things in their lives that they are having problems with and are looking for people who are willing to help. I believe any other judgement of morality should be decided by the people. We have no right punish for any wrongdoings, only lessons to teach. Therefore anyone who joins this ""religion"" should be willing to actively better themselves as well as help others without being hateful or condescending no matter the issue at hand.

As for the goals of this community, We will introduce people the the idea of meditation and focusing on being introspective. We will help people better their physical and mental health. Motivate people to make positive changes in their lives and nurture the idea that you are equal to any man or animal on the earth. I personally do not believe that we should hold ourselves higher than ""animals"" simply because we have evolved a stronger mind. But everything is up for discussion!

The problem is that I can't be out of the country (Spain) for more than 10 months out of the next 5 years if I want to get permanent residency. I also can't be out of the country for more than 6 months out of the year.

I'm currently living in Colombia and I've been here for 4.5 months. I've met loads of friends here and I really want to go and live in Brazil, Mexico, and Morocco as well (I'll be going with friends).

But at the same time, I don't want to lose my residency &amp; my family also wants me closer to the UK so they can visit me. Although, if I meet a girl in the future, I have no problem moving to here country and living.

I also want to travel to Andalusia in Spain and Barcelona, and Madrid. I wouldn't mind staying for 3 months in each city so I can really experience it.

And I work remotely so money is no issue for me but I really don't know what to do. My opinion keeps changing about whether to return to Spain or to go to Mexico, Brazil, or Morocco. One thing is for sure though, I don't want to return to the UK.

So today , a friend of mine talked to him because I wanted to see whether he will accept me in front of my brothers as his 'love' . My friend pretended as my cousin brother . In midway , he realized that the guy he is talking to is not my brother rather just someone who is doing all this as I told him to .  
See , I know this was a stupid idea but he confessed his love in the weirdest way possible . He is 21 and I'm 18 . Tbh , he is my dream guy but all my friends are like 'You must not talk to him' , 'He is so obsessed with you' , etc when I sent them screenshots . He was not in a good mood today and he talked very rudely with my friend . In case you want to see , check my profile . 

I mean my dude got looks , money , power , everything ! Honestly , I don't want to lose him . We have very different cultures and religions . His mother likes me a lot . My father too likes him but the fuckin' problem is that we do not share same 'Religion' . He understands all this well . He tried his best to control his anger but yesterday he lost his calm . I saw his anger for the first time and I was scared . He just loves me !

We blocked each other yesterday but whole night , I kept crying and he too could not sleep . Today he called my father (they have really good bonding) and told him to tell me that he needs to talk to me . I unblocked him , talked to him and started crying . I could sense by his voice , he was trying his best to control his tears . He never felt so low , I know !

He didn't beg for a relationship rather just told that he loves me and will respect my decision . I told him no and he said he understands ..

IDK where we both are heading and what to do next . If I tell this at home , they'll surely tell me to end all contacts with him . His father will never accept me . All I want is that he should be happy . I want to kiss him and keep him close to me . He had no energy today . He dint even attend classes . He is the type of guy who gets affected by none but today he was so low . I want him to be cheerful again . I'm feeling guilty . He is so pure , he just takes all responsibilities . He is perfect . He gave me so much , I don't even have words . I'm cunning . I'm bad . I dont feel good . I just cant see him like this !!

I find myself in a situation where I'm at a loss of what to do. I (22M) am a Computer Science engineer (specialized in Machine Learning) who decided, after graduating last year, to keep going with my studies and pursue an AI master.
We're midway through the first year, but my situation changed a lot. I don't feel like the master is bringing me enough and will be dropping out at the end of the year to get into the professional world.
This means I will not have any degree to show for that year, although I have not been idle either. Ive been research assistant in two different labs, teaching assistant from now on until May... Anyway.
I have a new class starting just now that looks hard (apparently pass rate for last year's students was around 20%, partly because of bad teacher, partly because of bad material, partly because of remote, partly because of poor organization... But I digress) and I can still deregister.
I'm wondering if I should keep it, when I already have a lot of stuff going on (research assistant, TA, personal projects to improve my profile for upcoming job applications, interview practice, plus trying to maintain mental health by staying somewhat social, practicing my instrument, reading...), I don't feel like it's bringing me too much that would be valuable for the jobs I want to apply to... And most of all it's hard, and I don't want recruiters to ask for my grades for this current year and see something horrible.

Now, you might read this and be convinced already, I should drop the course. I beg you to reconsider and try to remove the bias out of my words (I already want to drop the course, and doubtlessly my phrasing reflects that). The course doesn't bring me anything? Its a stat course, and stats are always useful in ML. I don't want recruiters to see something bad, but the course is mandatory if I want to graduate (which is well and good, but I don't want to graduate, I'm leaving in 5 months 🤔... But this is probably once again the bias speaking).
Finally, another reason which makes me doubt my choice is that my parents are hellbent on me keeping the course and finishing the year with all that goes along with it. I already presented them with the aforementioned arguments however, and they told me that ""maybe I was right""... Which doesn't make it any easier, being right over my parents happens rarely enough that I'm forced to think I'm overlooking something.

Anyway, that's it.

First time poster to LifeAdvice and infrequent reddit user here. I'm 30. And I was a complete moron as a teenager who absolutely hated school. I dropped out of high school, but did manage to complete my GED, and though I managed to enter college, I still managed to flunk out after the first term.  
Somehow, miraculously, I've managed to find a job I love and enjoy. The circumstances are a bit abnormal, though and the missing college degree catches up with me every time I have to go through this same song and dance: job hunting.  
Not sure how I've managed to be cursed with such a curse of instability, but for the past 4 or 5 years, it seems like I have to job hunt every year. Go figure, in early spring this year, I've been informed that I will need to find a new job. Let me cut to the chase: I don't have a degree, the jobs I have held surprisingly have not required a degree, but that's not normal. Most employers for my job typically require a degree. The missing degree has been a thorn in my side and has caused tons of heartache. I've been going about this in the honest way; just being up front with employers that I don't have a degree, but the reality is...that honesty usually just closes shut more doors than it opens.  
I tried looking into taking an online bachelors program. Considering how much I love my career, I'd actually be excited to learn how to do it more proficiently, but one quote from a school was $49k, which is money I don't have. It seems the boat on affordable education has sailed. (not to mention the availability of time)  
I also considered having a fake diploma printed. Of course I am aware it's dishonest, and I don't really want to do it this way, but every year this job hunt feels like it's getting more and more difficult. I'm running out of employers that are willing to overlook the credentials. However, many of these diploma printing sites are...unsurprisingly...fishy af. Their prices are absurd, but I'd be willing to pay them if I 100% felt confident I am getting what they promise, but searching around I see more people claiming they're scams then actual legitimate companies. 

The part that frustrates me the most is that most employers are not looking for a degree *in a specific field*. It's just some sort of back-water, ancient philosophy that their employees need to have graduated University and have **a degree**. So many of the people who get hired have very little experience in the field, however I have over 7 years experience, have done tons of self-study to improve myself, and regularly get recognized for my abilities. But because dumb-fuck me 10 years ago was a lazy POS, it's rare for an employer to even give me the time of day for an interview (let alone a job)

What do I do? Is it worth taking the $400 risk on a fake diploma? Do I just keep being honest to employers? Maybe I should just omit the education portion from my resume so hopefully I can at least explain in the interview? Or is there affordable online bachelors degree programs?

I am at a stage of life where I dont know what to do anymore, my father loaned around 20k$ with our only apartment as a collatral and spent all my education money (20k$) in his buissness plan which was a total doom, now I am in 2nd sem of my college pursuing an animation degree, I dont work as I dont get time to do so after college and assignments, its a rigorous 4 year degree, he even loaned my moms jewelleries on some debt he has piled up on top of that (10k$) so my family is in a total debt of 50k$ in a country where even earning 20k$ per year is an achievement. My mom cries everyday and its a pain to see

I have been given an option by my moms side of family to move to their state and move around eye machines to different doctors to earn money and pay off debt, the pay is around 15k $ per year not including any amenities like food and housing. 

I really dont know what I should do, continue with my degree while piling more debts and handouts from family members or just go into this machine business. I am sad most of the days and I dont know if I would earn good money after this degree.

If I work with my moms side of family I wont be able to get an education for atleast 5-6 years. I dont want to see my mom sad, I dont want to waste my life thinking I didnt do something while I had a chance. I just want my parents to be happy and live retirement.

Sometimes I think I should just kms and get all these problems over with, I got a bad disease when I was young so I wasn't able to pursue education early on, I am good with computers, animation and design thinking but I dont really see if that would let me earn a lot where median pay for these jobs are 10k$ per year.

I am 18 year old south asian male. To give some context. Growing up i used to be very cute, i remember this specific incident where a girl i had a crush on in my primary school pulled my cheeks cuz she found me quite cute. I used to have these protruding ears and as i started to grow older the ears became very large and protruding to a point where in my high school years, my classmates started to call me mr bean. And to be very honest, i really was not bothered. I dont know why it did not bother me. And around that same time i moved to another part of the city, so the friends i had been with for almost 7 years were replaced. And the new people were not necessarily bad or anything but i just couldn't see a friend in them. So, i did not even bother interacting with them as much. I used to prefer staying at home and watching YouTube. This resulted in my social skills taking a toll. So i became an introvert. But my new classmates still used to call me mr bean. It was not bullying or anything but unlike before it started to get on my nerves. My appearance started to really bother me. And around the same time, i found the black pill which is basically a philosophy about attractive people having it easier in life.
And also there are these looks rating subreddits where i used to post my photos for a rating and they most of the times rated me 4-5 which is basically below average to slightly average. That made it worse for me. I went on this 2 year long depression. Also which contributed to this is the fact that i am from an asian ( south asian to be more specific) family. In asia, families are very brutally honest. My own mother, whenever she pulls up my old photos she tells me,""look how cute you were back then now you look like a monkey"" and it is kinda soul crushing. Also my aunt who could be considered as my elder sister cuz she is kinda with me, whenever i jokingly say something like,""oh look! I look so handsome in this picture""
She would say the exact thing my mother says. And yesterday i jokingly talked about something which has no relation to my face/it was not even a mean comment about her but, she replied with a very mean comment about my face. And to be clear my mother is very supportive and loving. She never does anything which would hurt me except for the thing mentioned above.
I would be lying if i said that it did not make me su*******l.
I won't go through all the flaws i have not just facially but physically but my for most people, they have something to make them more attractive. Hell at least, most have good hair and/or beard genetics. I have none. So genetically i am fucked. Mentally i am fucked. Socially i am FUCKED.
And for the past few months i am trying to improve myself. Like i have been working out and have made good progress. I have seen a dermatologist to get my acnes treated. In short, i am trying to make a difference through the choices i am given. I am a bright student. And have the goal of becoming a software engineer.
I am becoming more mature in the way i am approaching the situation
And i have kinda accepted the fact that i would be always like this and on the surface level that now does not bother me but every 2-3 days i would have those depressing thoughts again,""why? Why me? At least i should have given good hair or beard (i know its to young for me to grow a beard but i look a lot like my father and he can't grow even a moustache let alone a beard) something""
And every time i look at the reflection of myself in the mirror even though i have accepted the harsh reality, i would still feel a bit sad. And the biggest fear of my is being judged by other people.
I need a practical logical approach to this whole situation. And please dont give me the "" everyone is unique and beautiful in their own way"" bullshit.
I am looking for proper advice from whom who have been through the same situation, who at least can relate.

The past year I've been installing granite with a great, reputable company. Unfortunately the shops we worked for no longer seem to appreciate us as subcontractors and the prices we charged for our experience so I got word that the company is shutting down to focus on their cabinet side of the business. 

I am not up in the air. I have a tile setting/granite company trying hard to secure me because of my experience and they've heard about me through mutual mutual friends (?). They're offering upwards of $19 an hour with room for raises once I prove myself and learn more about the tile side. The only down side is I have to drive my own vehicle to job sites, some of which are an hour or more away. I hate putting that kind of wear on my vehicles (both 20 years old), also the average salary for a tile setter in my state is only around $36k a year. 

I also have a airduct cleaning company offering me the job for $18 an hour plus commissions. The only downside is I feel it's not a ""cool"" or interesting job and I'm honestly not excited about it. It's about 30 minutes away and then I'll have my company vehicle for actually working.  They work 4 days a week. 

I ultimately want to be either a plumber, electrician, or hvac tech. The airduct cleaning company could, I suppose, open the hvac door a little bit more but not much. 

I hate turning down job offers but I know I'm going to have to. I just can't decide which to turn down and I pretty much have to decide by tomorrow.

I don't think my story is unusual however no matter where I searched online I can't find someone going through the same thing. 

I'm 26 years old, currently working in a job that I don't like and that pays me too little. My whole life I had to deal with things not going as planned. Everytime I set a goal or say I wanna do something, everything goes wrong. I guess it's what's described as being unlucky. 

I also had to deal with negativity. My parents always compared me to others and to them my efforts aren't enough, I'm not enough. I'm aware that this is not where I want to be in life and this is absolutely not what I deserve but I feel hopeless, unmotivated. I keep telling myself I need to find another way but then a voice inside my head speaks and tells me what's the point? And that I'll just end up failing again. 

I have anxiety and I deal with stress everyday at work which affected my health severely. But why I can't do anything about it? Why do I keep falling back instead of moving forward?

These past few days I don't even recognize myself. I have 10 days off yet I've already spent 3 days in my room, laying on the bed barely eating or drinking. This is not how I wanna be and I do have the will to change but I can't find the courage to do it. I feel like I'm not enough but I know I'm not doing enough to feel enough?!

Right now I'm a 20 something year old questioning every choice I made so far and I don't really have someone to talk to about certain things. 
I am currently enrolled at University and even though my courses are very interesting and I have enjoyed the half semester I had with at least some in-person activities before everything moved back online, I don't think I want to go for a career in the fields available afterwards. However most of my other interests would require me to leave University and go a more vocational road. Now I don't have a problem with that and it wouldn't be a problem for my parents either, they just want me to have some sort of plan for my future, but that's my problem I don't have one.
Now that I'm in the middle of the exam phase I start to see just how much alike University is to regular school in my country. By this I mean that I don't really learn things I'm yet again foregoing actually taking in the course topics to cram exactly the details my professors want to hear to get good grades. That system is why I dreaded going to school most mornings for the past 13 years and I mean dreaded the only thing that kept me going was the thought that someday that will be over. I was so focused on just getting through school that I never made any plans for what to do afterwards. 
In all honesty I think I am just afraid of being that aimless again. With University at least I kind of know what the next day will bring but if I quit I'm back to where I was a year ago after I finished school, going to some Mini-job every other day to keep at least some money coming in and no idea what to do with myself, no idea for my future.
So I guess what I'm asking for here is if you fellow redditors have any advice on what I should do, look for some opportunities in other fields I have an interest in for the long run or keep moving on with University and see if the next semster will be better for me.

A) I go to university for 3+ years and rent a place with one of my close friends and have the time of my life. Parents would support me with money even tho its tight and I would be away from home. I would still continue chasing my goals even in university. But the main reason of going to university is the fact that I still don't have to work and will have free time to chase my dreams while trying to barely pass the exams and at the same time I'm getting a education which can provide me a higher paying job  in the future and social status if my goal doesn't work out.

B) I just start working a minimal wage job and chase my goals  while I feel like a failure **(until it starts paying enough that  I can quit my job)** cause I won't be tending higher education. And won't have as much as free time, but my parents will save up the money they would give me to attend university.

I did my Bachelors in New York but then came back to Pakistan because honestly, compared with the hassle and work of building up a life alone abroad, my life here is very comfortable. I live in my parents house, which is considered a very normal thing here. Even if I got a house of my own my parents would move with me, there is basically no concept of separating from your fam, which honestly I have no problem with because I like my family life. I work in the family business and used to do a lot of freelance work on the side, and considering I live in Pakistan anything I made from freelance alone was enough for pretty good living. 
But slowly im getting older 27(M) and for a guy here it's a huge deal to not be married yet. I have no interest in getting married, but there is a lot of family pressure. Jus FYI arranged marriage is the common custom here. Eventually I gave in and got engaged, but that engagement was broken due to a unexpected and honestly unlikely reasons. Now its been a few months and honestly I'm still not over that whole ordeal but my parents are already trying again to ""arrange a marriage"" for me and they're going at it full force because somehow they see it as their failure that I'm not married yet. 
Honestly I don't wanna deal with that but considering I live under their roof and a lot of my lifestyle is dependent me working the family business, I feel stuck and obligated to do as they say. I've considered moving abroad but I don't have enough savings for that. I've considered applying for masters but I'd have to pay for that myself and again I don't have the savings for that. My main source of income is the business, and unless and until I become completely financially free from my parents influence I'll always feel a sense of obligation to do as they say (because even though they don't understand, they're not malicious, it's jus they're from an older time and they cannot comprehend me going through life unmarried).
I was taking a break from freelance to relax after my engagement broke but I'm gonna start that back up to build up savings but honestly I don't feel it'll be enough. I don't know what direction to go in career wise, or in terms of my personal life. If I do move abroad to study/work I'll have to give up my entire lifestyle and all my family and friends but if I stay I'll eventually be pressured into a marriage and somehow that seems just as bad if not worse (just based on the horrible marriages I've seen in general and on here).
I don't even know what advice I'm asking for, my brain kinda stops working when it comes to my own life. I'm really trudging through my days right now, any direction or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I took a crummy retail job at 21 because i needed a job. I blinked and 10 years went by....

&amp;#x200B;

Ill be 32 this year. I live in a small Northern NJ apartment. No college education. No girlfriend. No clue. I thought i wanted to go in one direction but the closer i got, the more uninterested i became. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stayed at my low paying retail job because im loyal. The people i work with have really become like a family. They took care of me and i returned the favor. But i dont have much in life. Im incharge of a lot at work and its very physical.

&amp;#x200B;

When i moved into my current apartment...i went to thr psychic downstairs just for fun. She mentioned i would own a small business. Ive been known to be the handyman at work so i see potential in that but i dont have much experience. Then the covid lockdown happened and everything was put on pause.

&amp;#x200B;

I spend my days off hanging around the apartment watching tv...drinking...relaxing... Just haning out, you know? Low energy after a weeking of working. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the last few years Ive been watching all my friends propose to their girlfriends, get married buy houses and now kids. And ive never felt more lonely. I would love to have a girlfriend but who would date a guy with a low paying job? These are things i wish to have and im afraid ill never have a good job, find a girl or get married and will die alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont really know where im going with this but...has anyone been in a similar situation? The last 10 years of my life have been wasted because i have no idea what to do.

I’m 24 going on 25 and I haven’t even graduated community college yet. I spent 7 years in community college because neither of my parents wanted to put their tax information so I could get help with student loans. I got blamed for not finishing school by the age of 22 by my dad even though all I had to help aid me was a part time job while still having to pay for other bills. I paid out of pocket what I could but it’s gotten me no where. I mean I have around 45 credits at one school but then I had to move to my moms house and practically start over. When I turned 24 I took advantage of finally being able to pay for college but I feel I am too late. My depression and how hopeless I feel has gotten the best of me. I ended up dropping or failing practically all my classes I’ve ever signed up for after moving in with her. I’ve waisted 2 years of my life in that house with nothing to show, I could have been halfway done by now. Here I am 24 going on 25, moved back to my dads because my mom was toxic. I feel lost and scared. I fear I’m too late to even attempt to go to a university to just get this over with and get a degree. I fear that at this point I’m burnt out and that college isn’t for me anymore. All I keep thinking about is how I have to sit here in retail for 4 more years and hopefully get accepted to a university and live in a dorm as I have no where else to live after the summer is over. No one ever explained to me how anything in life works. I was practically thrown into the world and blamed for things not going the way it should for other people my age. I was given no help or support at all and I have no clue what I’m doing with my life. I don’t even know how to explain or express all the things running through my head. My life just feels so pointless and I feel so alone and worthless. Even my own grandmother told me she didn’t believe I would graduate. No one believes in me, they just blame me. I’m the only sibling that doesn’t have their shit together but it’s not my fault. I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing and I just want my life to end already. I really do just feel pointless and unloved by my family. I have no hope for myself anymore. I don’t even have the mental strength and stability to even finish this semester.

About me: UK based, 27 years old, university graduate, young professional etc. Never had a particularly well paying job but have great savings (£70k) due to living with parents for a long time and being frugal. My only big asset is my car worth £7k but I also have no liabilities other than student loan.

About a month ago I left a job I had as it was affecting my mental health. This job paid about £1.8k a month (about £30k per annum). I had nothing lined up which was pretty bold of me but my goal was to find something I enjoyed and gives me purpose/fulfilment in life; bonus points if it's well paid but that was not my primary focus.

By pure luck and a bit of networking, I fell nicely on my feet and I've got a 21st century form of income that pays very well but takes up all of my time. It's not what I expected to do, however I'm not in the corporate world of attending stand up calls each morning, back to back Zoom meetings, and checking my emails throughout the day while doing boring tasks.

What I'm doing now is not my standard career-based/professional job but it pays well. It's not 0nly f@ns, Btc related, adult work or anything illegal, however it's not your traditional job either. I'd rather not discuss what it is as that shouldn't change what I'm trying to ask :). I can say though that it's relatively easy, working from home, low stress and I feel in control of everything.

I'm taking home approx £5k a month from this. If I stuck it out, it could go on for a few months, or it could go on for years; I will never know and will live with that uncertainty. However it allows me to really save for my future.

I've got an interview tomorrow for a job that would be really rewarding. It's working for a mental health charity rehabilitating prisoners so they can settle back into civilisation in a way and giving them the care and protection they need so they won't be vulnerable or reoffending. It sounds amazing and I was super keen to join despite the low pay (£22k per annum). I live in a cheap part of the country (Newcastle) but still that's a low salary when you consider cost of living rising.

But I recently had second thoughts. It seems crazy to leave what I'm currently doing which is an incredible opportunity to set myself up for life. As amazing as the mental health job would be, I think my monthly salary would be approx what I'm currently earning per week.

Do you think I'd be crazy for leaving what I'm doing now?

In addition, I'm applying to become a firefighter. This involves lots of tests spread out over a length period of up to 6 months (all tests are unpaid). This is another 'job' that I'd love and get a lot of fulfilment and life purpose from, knowing I'm benefiting the community, potentially saving lives and making a difference to people's lives. It's also low paying job of a similar salary and I wouldn't be joining it for the pay, but the opportunity cost of leaving such a good form of income at the moment puts me in a difficult position about becoming a firefighter in 6-12 months (if I pass all the tests).

Both firefighting and the mental health job would have some career progression but right now I'm hitting the ground running in terms of building up my savings.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28492,public,self,High paying 'job' that isn't a career vs career-based job?,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/smrcwa/high_paying_job_that_isnt_a_career_vs_careerbased/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,

The first one is my living situation. I am living together with my cousin in small apartment in a rural area. Because of that and Covid I haven‘t been able to really find friends here. I moved here for my apprenticeship. All my friends live an hour away. This makes my everyday life pretty lonely and boring. I can‘t really meet friends and have a social life as I would like too. It also hurts my dating life. I feel trapped here with no way to break out any time soon. 
After work I tend to just waste my life away in front of my phone. I implemented a few rituals to brighten my day and distract me (working out and going for walks, reading, doing as much as possible with friends on the weekends) which definitely helps but there is still so much time that I feel like I am wasting away and it doesn’t make the bigger issues any less present. 
I have this huge urge to finally move into a big city and meet new people, have parties, new experiences and all that. The problem is I am still locked in this area for about a year until I have finished my apprenticeship here. There is nothing I can really do except move to a slightly larger city and hope I can find some local friends there (which would be a lot more expensive to the point where I would have to rely on my parents again). 
Another thing is that I am really unsatisfied with my apprenticeship. I hate it but I am too far in to just quit…I am constantly bored out and hate my field in general. My final exams are in November. All I know is that I want to finish this as soon as possible and go to Uni and do something that actually interests me and provides me with a more fulfilling occupation. So the earliest I could start studying and move away would be Spring 2023. So about a whole year into the future. Tbh I am scared of having to wait an entire year to actually live and create the life l want. It feels like my life is on pause. 
How can I deal with being so unsatisfied in so many different areas with no immediate solution in sight? I thought about going to therapy because together with Covid this put me in a pretty depressive mood in the last 1,5 years but that would just help my cope with the symptoms and not help with actual problem.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28488,public,self,How to deal with wanting to turn your life around but currently not being able to do so,0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/smlmpk/how_to_deal_with_wanting_to_turn_your_life_around/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,

I need advice and help of real experienced people with situations like this so I can do my best to make this right. 

3 years ago, January 2019 my father (49 at the time) (52 rn) went into my older sister’s (20 at the time, 23 now, we’ll call her A) room one morning and touched on her body. (Chest and lower areas) She resisted but he kept going and stopped only after she screamed. 

We went to church that day and he preached (he’s the pastor of our church…) and to me it was like nothing happened. I only found out later that night when him and my younger sister (16 at the time, 19 now, we’ll call her B) came to my room with sad faces on and at first I had thought something happened to my mom (who was away on a flight to their African home country) but my dad said she was fine. He knelt in front of where I was sitting and said he went into (B’s) room and “touched her inappropriately” my father broke down crying after he said it and said “I’m not a molestor” “I don’t know what got into me” “please” and begged for forgiveness immediately 

I was shocked. I went to my sisters room to make sure she’s okay and she said she feels like telling someone. I mentioned that if she did that he would go to jail. We waited till my mother got back and tell her. 

Well before that he was asking us how we’re going to tell mom or if we should, and we said she has to know. 

Before we told my mom my father had said to us that he had to tell us something, that the day it happened his “stepmom” must have sent a voodoo attack on him to control him and cause him to do that. And honestly for a bit as an African kid who’s heard so many different black magic stories in the church I believed this (probably because I didn’t want to see him in bad light because I’ve always known my father to be kind, generous and caring besides this situation) but it started not to make sense after a while. He also mentioned something about a dream he had having sex with his stepmother… 


My dad then pulled out his wallet and had paid us money for “compensation” of “the traumas he caused us” and kept saying “I wish I could turn back time but this is all I can do”

Anyways about a (long) week goes by AND my mom finally is home and we tell her. 

My mom was more shocked than me and basically had a panic attack and my dad kept saying “I’m sorry please forgive me I’m sorry I didn’t have sex with her I’m sorry”

He told my mom the same voodoo bit. 

This is the part where I’m still having trouble TODAY. 

My mom didn’t do anything about it, besides say if he does it again she will call the police, but that she doesn’t think he will do it. She claims he’s not a “deep thinker” and that “something must have come over him” and that we should “trust in god that he won’t do it again” 


and yet I have 3 sisters (youngest one is now 17 today and doesn’t even have a clue my father is capable of something like this, we didn’t tell her because she was young)  in the house and one is already a victim of my father. I question the other things he’s done in his past. 

Oh I also found out recently that he’s cheated on my mom in the past during their marriage, and it was with a 19 YEAR OLD GIRL. My father claims it happened in 2009 and that she was a classmate of his college and that she brought him to the car and she just “started sucking his dick” that’s what he told me. His son. 

Also during me confronting him multiple times in recent months he’s said that “I’m the only one that’s giving him problems, and that im not “greeting him” and “frowning my face” when he sees me” 

My father lied to me and the family when I brought up the voodoo thing and said the same thing that something came over him and he felt like something left his body when my sister screamed then he walked out. “If you look at it does it seem normal to you” he often says when asked about the situation and then proceeds to say “I’m sorry” a billion times and puts on a sob face. 


My sad came to me later after that family meeting with my mom and sisters when he knew I was alone and said the truth: that my sister had shown her father (whom she trusted so much: her nipple piercings she got in 2019 and she was scared to show my mom because my mom would get mad) and it “turned him on” His words. 

(Another shocking moment for me. All this built up shock and yet I’ve not been able to express it all till this day……I need a therapist I can trust…) 

The thing is my mom and sisters pretty much “moved on” from it and just accepted it as something of the past from what it looks like. 


Oh my dad also mentioned that “people that tell other people’s secrets outside get hurt” when I said that my mom needs to know about him cheating. “I’m not saying anything is gonna happen” “I’m just saying” This isn’t something a father should say to their son???? 

Regardless of anything I still told my mom about 3 months ago and my relationship with my father is pretty much just two people who live in the same household right now, we don’t talk much. Not that I have much to say to him besides angry statements I would regret, after all after I found out about the cheating and that he still blamed me for not “greeting him” I shouted “I lost my respect for you as a man!” At him and felt sorry enough to apologize to him the next day. I don’t want to hate anyone. I don’t want to punish anyone or destroy myself in the process of trying to revenge to someone, or feel like it’s my job to punish someone. I just want this situation to be right.


I fear that if I leave this house my father could prey on one of my sisters again. I fear that I can’t bring my future gf home or future daughters home because he may do something similar to what he did or god forbid maybe even worse when given an opportunity and nobody is home… What if my sister didn’t scream when he did what he did…?? Would he have stopped? 

Anyways 

I need advice. My mom said she doesn’t know what to do anytime I’ve brought it up to her and says that us calling the cops means that my dad loses his job and if I want him to go to jail? I said that’s not what I want at all, I just want it to be right. 

And she says that kicking him out would mean that her “children continue without a father and doesn’t know how we would cope” but the fact of the matter is I think my dad does just enough to make it look like he’s for the best interest of everyone else but it’s only to cover up whatever else he’s doing. He frequently asks my youngest sister if she’s done with homework but never actually checks to make sure it’s done. I think he only asks just to ask. I question who my father is everyday and It’s hard to even converse with him because all I can think about is what he did. 

My mom says it’s “unforgiveness” but I think it’s a matter of not being a fool, and forgetting key evidence. Not name calling anyone else but speaking solely for me. 


We never told my sisters about the real reason my dad did that, I didn’t want a traumatized person to reignite and worsen those feelings within her. My mom knows about the cheating and the nipple piercing thing though. 

Anyways I’m stuck 


I need adults/ experienced people to give me real WISDOM. I don’t want to do anything I’ll regret but I also don’t want one of my sisters to get hurt again and truthfully I don’t trust my dad. I lock my door when I sleep because I don’t know what he could do. Maybe he’s angry I told my mom about him cheating, maybe he sees me as a threat because I’m the only one who won’t let the situation go… regardless if he can put his hands on someone else forcefully, I don’t know what else he thinks of doing, and I’m not going to just give opportunity when I’m not trusting of someone. 


Anyways please. I’ve said enough, I need wisdom and help. I think daily of what someone would think of me and I judge myself. if they knew I was harboring such a secret. 

and that’s literally what I  it is, me holding secrets for someone who should not have done something to ruin our trust in the family in the first place.  


My father also blamed pornography and said that porn can make someone do something like that. I have been watching porn since I was 13 and I was alarmed by that.

Now that I’m independent and okay with myself mentally, I feel painful regret and frustration when I see couples, romance movies on tv etc. Also, it feels like there’s an invisible wall of thoughts between myself and other people, especially women I’m interested in. I feel so frustrated because I want to say so much to them NOW, and want to live through 14 love stories in a span of one day. Being patient and mindful of others feels impossible. Focusing on school and career goals is also hilariously challenging. I wanna cry and laughter at the same time because this just feels so unfair - especially because my friends and other people have experienced it all, and even my family is questioning if I’ll ever have a romantic relationship. I want to crawl out of my body…

Forget about Holidays, I will be working pretty much all of them, lol. The best things about my current retail job- no stress. It's easy. I work closely enough with managers that I know that I could handle it. Honestly- easiest 60k you could ever make. Although I will say, I do like having days off that break up the week. It's kind of nice to work just 3 days, have a day off, work 2 more days then have another day off. I guess my main question is- if you've worked retail before and then got a ""real"" job. Do you feel it was worth it? Am I loving the ""idea"" of Sat Sun off, but maybe over exaggerating how good it is? To summarize-

Current job-

Easy, 60k, Bonuses, Dividend checks, Not a desk job, job security. 

Corporate job-

Set schedule Mon-Fri, Holidays off, possibly more money, no job security, work could be harder and hours could be longer.

The issue with the other jobs is that I just lose all motivation after I've learnt how to do the job. I get my training done, work for a month (MAYBE) and then I just get so depressed with the routine and cant be asked anymore so I leave and looks elsewhere, but there seems to be nothing better. I hate it. Sometimes its so hard to even get out of bed before a shift because I know its gonna be another meaningless 8 hours doing the same menial task over and over. My longest stint was at home depot. I worked there for almost 9 months and frankly I loved it. I loved every second working there, albeit it wasnt the greatest work (hard on the body, I was worked like a fucking horse, etc etc) But there was always something new that happened, some new issue or something I could work to resolve. It gave the work meaning in a way. I also had the pleasure of working with the best coworkers I couldve asked for. But I fucked up and threw that away because during covid we started doing curb side pick up, and I lost everything and anything that mightve been ""new"" on a day to day basis. Just the same menial bullshit, pick an order, stage the order, find an order, take out the order. and it just depressed me. like it does everywhere else and it got to the point where again even just getting out of bed was an issue and I just stopped going. Its not like i wasnt working hard when I was there, like I wouldve been fired or something, frankly from what I heard I did a great job while I was there, but I just couldnt go anymore. and for that I feel like an absolute piece of scum. I havent been there for over a year now but it just eats away at me every day. Even when I'm trying to sleep sometimes I wind up thinking about how badly I messed up a great opportunity and then I lose sleep over it. I still wish that I could go throw in a resume and maybe just maybe get to go back. But why would they take me back after that? I simply don't deserve it.   
I also was (and still am) a stupid kid who didnt give a shit in highschool. so my grades werent all that great which makes getting a higher education even harder ontop of the fact that I cant afford that shit. idk.

I have a great job that's fully remote, it's not the most exciting job but I don't mind doing it. I've got some hobbies I enjoy, I like to skateboard, hike with my dog, workout, code, play guitar...I keep busy haha. 

On the whole though I feel like I've got no direction, I've got no place of my own, no goals, no dreams, no girlfriend, no real close friends though I do have a few good ones. I just have no idea what I'm doing, right now it all kind of feels pointless. When I think about who I am or what I want to do with my life while I'm still young, I draw blanks and get stressed. I could just pack up everything I own right now in my truck and leave, staying in rentals around the country but I've got nowhere I really want to go. Sometimes I think maybe I'm depressed, but then I think well depressed people usually don't have the motivation to workout every day like I do or go skateboard when 20 it's degrees out; then again, I do really have to force myself to do these things sometimes. It's an odd feeling, things are not so bad and I could definitely go on like this until I die but I feel like I'm missing out on something. Sometimes I think about joining the military and being a part of something bigger than myself, but then I think boot camp would probably suck being 28 with a bunch of 18 year olds and it would really suck to be locked into something like the military for like 3 to 5 years if I hated it. I've thought about going back to school and trying to get a masters and maybe a phd in something (I have a b.s in Environmental Science, but work as a programmer/analyst). I enjoyed academics and always learning new things...but I do that on my own for free now and I don't have anything I'm really passionate about to study. Sometimes I think about what would happen if I won the lottery and it actually stresses me out because I have no idea what I would so with myself if suddenly I did not have to work anymore. My work gives me some purpose at least and without that I think I'd be even more lost. Weekends are the worst for me because I very rarely have plans to do anything. I enjoy the morning when I usually get a workout in and study/practice something but once I'm done I just don't know what to do. The work week is nice because before I know it's time for bed and I don't really have to think about it.

I would like to sum the whole story by the most important events, and since I am in a very bad place now, any suggestions are welcome.

I lost my father at 19 due to lungs cancer, and since then a rough 10 years passed.

Diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression. Got pills for that, so I can concentrate on my studies.

I finished college, got a job... Living with a sick mother (she was also depressed).

At 26, met a really nice girl, and we started a relationship. At this point, I was still on pills.

I was unaware of my feelings, although I tried to articulate if I love her or just liked her because of her character. I couldn't figure it out no matter how hard I tried. She on other hand loved me. A lot. I also got the feeling that through our relationship, I was the one who is pushing both of us forward. She was always a little too fragile for real life. So sometimes, I felt exhausted, I got mom's situation, work, and just got a feeling that something is not right. It was not a boring relationship, but she was a dreamer (in a nice way), and just wanted to stay home, or go on walks. But I got a feeling that no matter how much I told her about things that I miss in our relationship, she couldn't figure out a way...

Mom got sick, and because of her condition doctor told us he could not perform surgery on her aneurism and basically we went home waiting for her to die.

My girlfriend was still the same, and one day after a 1-hour ride to her town just to see her, and not talk about anything, I went home. I called her and told her that she just do not understand how much effort I put into the relationship, and since I got a dying mother at home, I do not have enough relationship energy. She took it pretty bad.

Months passed and mom died from aneurism after she fell and broke a hip. It was a lot worse, and more painful losing her than my dad. After all, I was now alone in this world at 27. My family didn't call, friends were all busy, and I felt really lonely. And COVID also started.

My ex started calling me, and we started casually seeing each other. I knew that she was trying to get back together, and I didn't have anything against that. I just felt empty. And I was still on the meds for anxiety and depression.

She got a job in my town, so she asked me if we could be roommates. I knew that was just an attempt to get closer with me, but again I didn't have anything against it. Soon, she figured out I am emotionally unavailable and got back home after a few months. And then, for a few months, we didn't hear from each other.

In the past year, I was on some kind of a spiritual/emotional journey. I went to the other psychotherapist, and he was pretty good. I also went to church and talk to a priest, even if I was an atheist my whole life. Things got a lot clearer. I realized I was undeveloped in some ways, emotionally. That may be some people and friends around me got more serious about their lives as I was fighting my battles. I know everyone has their own pace, but I threw my ego and looked at my flaws. Also, I stopped using my pills (okay, as I write down I see where the plot is haha).

And as a final thing, I had a mini religious experience. I started going to church, mainly to talk with a priest that has a lot of life experience. And one day, I was in a church and started crying like a baby. I didn't cry for 15 years. Everything just got simple, and I could see everything wrong with my life.

I went home and started writing (I write poetry as a hobby, a really bad one. But it helps me with my emotional life). Song after song, I wrote about 15 in 3 days. I am not an ignorant person to that point that I do not see that stopping with my pills for anxiety got me a little emotionally exposed. I got that. But I also got that I was too long on the medication and that I missed so much of life. I was so emotionally unavailable that I couldn't see all her attempts to get back with me, and herlove. She tried more than a year to prove to me that she was willing to change and that she loves me. And I saw clearly that I love her. I was full of hope, and I thought, that's it.

I started writing to her, letter, song, then another song... And then I called her, I wanted to send her all of those. And then, here comes karma from a title - she tells me that she is in a relationship and that she loves that person, and plans a future together.

It was like a sky was falling. First time in my life, I found out what means when people tell you they can't feel their legs from shock. In less than 3 days I found out what is wrong with my life, that I am now alone in this world in every possible way, and that it hurts that someone I broke up with and did so wrong to her, is moving on with life. While I do not know what to do, and where to go with mine.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28447,public,self,Karma + bad luck.

essence of love. Liked the quote on break ups on how the one who leaves is always the one making tender speeches!\n\n**The art of observation:** How Proust could write 30 pages on something like the simple act of sleeping by closely examining the process, how he garnered things from conversations and read the newspaper with great interest to flesh out his characters. This if Romeo and Juliet had just been a story in the newspaper. It\'s how one says things that matters more. Avoiding cliches is important,  striving for an original language is important because how we express ourselves is how we feel. There are many ways to describe sunsets rather than just saying the sky turned orange red etc.  We should look for the familiar in art, link it to our knowledge of the world, eg: who does the painting remind you of, how does it relate to daily life.   “Every work of successful art has an ability to restore to our sight a distorted or neglected aspect of reality""\n\n**Value of reading:** The authors articulate wonderfully that which readers only understand without coherent intuition. Authors expand our understanding, so we read to understand ourselves.  This quote here:  “The value of a novel is not limited to its depiction of emotions and people akin to those in our own life; it stretches to an ability to describe these far better than we would have been able, to put a finger on perceptions that we recognize as our own, but could not have formulated on our own.”\n\n**Appreciating daily life:** An asparagus can be painted beautifully, with many colors, so we need not despair that our life is filled with glamour less stuff. We need to see with fresh eyes. Proust created worlds by what he read on a train timetable.\n\n**Criticism and diplomacy:** If you hate your friend\'s work, write two reviews, save one for yourself and send the polite one to him/her, preserve friendship, preserve truth!\n\nOverall, great read.

Authors expand our understanding, so we read to understand ourselves.  This quote here:  “The value of a novel is not limited to its depiction of emotions and people akin to those in our own life; it stretches to an ability to describe these far better than we would have been able, to put a finger on perceptions that we recognize as our own, but could not have formulated on our own.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appreciating daily life:&lt;/strong&gt; An asparagus can be painted beautifully, with many colors, so we need not despair that our life is filled with glamour less stuff. We need to see with fresh eyes. Proust created worlds by what he read on a train timetable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticism and diplomacy:&lt;/strong&gt; If you hate your friend&amp;#39;s work, write two reviews, save one for yourself and send the polite one to him/her, preserve friendship, preserve truth!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, great read. I am now onto Alian&amp;#39;s other works. He has some great videos on YT too which is how I stumbled upon this book. Curious to hear from folks who have read/tried reading Proust and what their experience from it has been.

I am 22 years old and my friend (let's call him Wane) is currently 32 years old. Wane has been in a relationship for over 18 years and recently they have broken up. He is not a bad person by all means and tried his best to get back together with no success. I am not here to ask for advice on how he can get back together. 

I have known Wane for 3 years now and he was never a sad person, always the most optimistic in any situation. But recently, because of the breakup, he is not handling it well at all, almost to the point of suicide. Whenver I see him, he has lost all signs of hope and enjoyment in life and it looks to me as he has lost his other half. I am so young but I always wanted to help this man as he taught me valuable life skills throughout our friendship. I am just so confused as to how I can seriously give him a helping hand and get his life back on track. 

It has been a month since the official break up and because of COVID, I was unable to help him in person, only through phone calls and text messages. Wane always had a drug problem since young because of his childhood and now, he is getting back to his old filthy habits. Wane has recently started seeing his old mates whomst indulges in narcotics and this made Wane disappear from reality and delved into a drug fest for a whole month. During this time, he also picked up a gambling habit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am just so fucking scared and worried for this man. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I have started talking to a girl I used to date online who lives in Australia. We were getting along great until all of a sudden she started seeming off. I persisted that she tell me what was wrong and after promising, I wouldn't leave she told me that she had been and currently is staying at a friend's house because she's scared of her room because of what her ex did to her. She told me that he had raised his fists at her and forced her to sleep next to him when she wanted a nap, then told me he did ""things"" to her while she slept. She is a minor and he is turning 19 next year (Or later this year). She hates him but can't tell her parents because her dad is on parole for possession of narcotics and she doesn't want him to get into more trouble by hurting her ex. She thinks it's her fault and despite my efforts to try to combat this, I believe she still thinks it is her fault. This isn't the first time a guy has pressured her into doing something she doesn't want to and I'm worried she's not going to get the help she needs. When I asked if she'd considered talking to a help hotline she rejected saying she didn't want to appear weak. I don't know what to do and since I live in New Zealand there's nothing I can physically do to help. I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself, not making sense, etc. I am scared and don't know what to do, if anyone has advice or could tell me where to find someone I would appreciate it more than you could imagine.  


Tl; DR: A girl has been abused by her ex and can't tell anyone as he is now an adult and she is a minor

We got into it because of how I was acting and also breaking house rules. My uncle decided to step in and take me under his wing which was beneficial but thing started getting out of hand as well. I didn’t have any intent on coming back home after moving but still had no guidance on how I would be able to make this possible since I didn’t have good credit nor a set time frame of how long my uncles hospitality would last. 

while staying there thing were going okay, I was focusing on my job and just wanted to save money, when times got stressful, I’d go to my gf house and try to chill with her to get thing off my mind. however due to poor communication and everyone just looking at me and not really saying what’s on their hearts things started to get toxic. my uncle would yell at me and tell me that I’d have to leave and threatened me that I’d be a loser if I did with no accepting home. 

lost, in the now toxic home I thought was welcoming I began to resort to what got me kicked out in the first place drinking and smoking until it’s all over. My choices weren’t as sharp as I just kept doing and it showed during my job and even got fired from a couple due to poor concentration and not taking things serious. though my uncle extended his help he’d talk behind my back and not really guide me just testing me as if I was in competition of taking his family away. things just started to get out of hand

I'm currently employed full time, a contractual employee to clarify to a high school as a janitor. The contract will run out by July 7th, as it was the official time in which I was hired on.

I have a vehicle that I've been co-leased into thanks to my asshole father whom I'm moving out from for the third time in my life. First time I moved from him was when I was 23, second time was when I was 28 and this time is when I'm 32. I just can't deal with him anymore with his oppressing list of issues with him that just stagnates my life.

Here's how my plan is going to go;

I'm going to stay with this job for 5 months, to fulfill my contractual obligations. I've got to save up at least $8,000 by then because the apartment I'm picking is $650 a month and I hope to get 5 months in by which should be enough time to quickly find a job in Iowa to keep the payments up.

As for my vehicle's lease agreement, it's on 48 months, 10,000 mile annual limit, $21,236.64 total payments broken down to $442.43 a month. My dad's the one paying for my insurance while I have to handle the car payment and he had to co-sign the lease for the vehicle to get me on board.

I plan to take this vehicle with me on my trip to Iowa. I want to rely no more on buses like Greyhound or take chances with even an airplane trip.

Now, her family won’t speak to me and they always treated me well. 

We have been friends since first grade. She was a bit ostracized and struggled to make friends but I was always there for her. Since then we were inseparable but as the years went by, I noticed her clingy, toxic behavior and hanging out seemed more like a chore to me. 

When we first started college is when things started to get bad I’d say. She wanted to speak every single day on the phone at a specific time. But I was busy doing homework and making friends of my own. I explained that to her and suggested once a week thing. If I didn’t text right away, she would call. If I didn’t pick up, she’d call my moms cell phone and house. My mom would of course worry but I was fine. When I was doing my own thing in college and admitted to hooking up with a guy one night, she called me a slut. I felt obligated to tell her that I hooked up with him even thought I felt the judgement. I told her because she held this status that “we are best friends” and best friends should tell each other everything…

Eventually she calmed down with setting up a time to call me everyday. I got a boyfriend and she wanted to see my texts with him and social media. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable showing her my texts with him but then threw back at me that I’m hiding stuff from her. She took my phone and deleted my messages with Him. I asked her about it and she said she had no idea. 

Fast forward few more years. We both graduated college and I told her I’m going to graduate school to become a teacher. She scared me and told me all of these horror stores from student teaching experiences her friends encountered. She just finished her graduate degree in teaching too. We now work in the same school as aides. Since I’ve gone back to school, she’s been acting weird and not very supportive. She gets upset when I ask my teacher friends for advice but not her.  And when I ask for answers, her answers her very vague. 

Recently, I went out for her birthday in the city. The birthday plans cost me over $500 if not more. Two weeks later I asked if she would like to go out for a birthday drink, and she said she couldn’t. After her party, she guilted and forced me to post a picture of her on Facebook of the party. She also hid me from seeing her photos on Facebook, her Instagram stories, and Facebook posts. Even my mom. 

We got into a tiff because I explained to her that she wasn’t very communicative with me about possibly giving me covid. But she told her work friends who she hung out way before me. Eventually I told her that I just need some space and she said that I’m treating her unfairly because her mom passed away a couple of months ago. Now she avoids me at work and some  days says hi. I feel like a bad person because her mom did pass away and I’ve known her for a long time. I lost my father at 23 and I never once used it as a comeback. 

Since we stopped talking, I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Like I just got out of a toxic relationship or something.

I need some advice. Let me give yall a bit of backstory. I’ve always been the Tech guy and went to school for Computer Science. About 2/3 of the way through, my passion started to waning. At the same time, I took a game development class. The 3d modeling portion of the class hit a spot I didn’t know existed. It took over a good chunk of my life at the time, but then I graduated and got an IT job. With work being work, I didn’t have the time for 3d modeling and eventually stopped. I later lost that job and with the extra free time, I got back into modeling. I fell down the Art rabbit hole, hard and fast. I tried everything that I could afford to do. I finally settled down on drawing and storyboarding. I wasn’t, and still not, good enough to make a living off it and needed money. So, I got another IT job and it feels so soul-draining. I'm trying my best atm to get my skill to a level where I can make a living from it. With my current pace, it'll likely take a while to reach that point.

Here is the part where I need some advice. I believe my skill in modeling is better than my drawing. Should I start practicing modeling again in an attempt to get something in the field sooner? I would still practice drawing/boarding, but it would be on the back burner. Or, should keep my focus on drawing/boarding and bear with the IT work.

It started from last year July after my father's sudden death because of covid, responsibility was suddenly shoved into his shoulder and I gotta say, that time was our time at bottom. It wasn't as bad as having loan or something but my father had lost all of his savings to Investment company in early covid. We was suddenly left with a little money that could only hold for a few years but none left for my college tuition. My father took almost most of the money leaving some for daily needs on his account and create a CV with two other people in hope that he could gain money for my tuition.

And so, after he left, the CV then left into my brother's hand. However, my mother had been hysterical at him being fooled and let all the money taken by other two person that is also on the share thus putting even more pressure at him.

I wouldn't say that we were raised as ""golden spoon"" but at least comfortable enough to never work hard on anything. Now my brother had to step up and work, either for people or open his business since he can't continue doing nothing now that there are no other income other than the cyber cafe that can't be an insurance since it's a business that could died anytime. People around him, the adults, have been worried since he's still amateur and naive on business though I see he could manage, somehow.

Then, it would be our mother. She is a person that is quick to anger and rather judgemental. She is quick to assume things and would throw out hurtful and sometimes guilt tripping words. I personally, had been suffering for a long time under her verbal abuse and in the past, physical abuse. And now, under the stress and pressure she had, she has been lashing out to both me and especially my brother.

It isn't a secret to me that none of our parents had had that much of faith and trust on my brother. They had especially distrust him a lot regarding money since he always spend all of his money away to God knows where. No, he isn't gambling addict, into drinking, smoking, or even drugs.

We had always wanted to get away from our mother's clutch since we had our share of trauma. Although the reason she's angry is right, as if that we're wasting our time playing games or maybe being messy and not responsible of our mess but her insults hurling at us hurts. So when she directs it to my brother, it causes him being depressed.

Fast forward, this is the Chinese New Year and we had planned a trip to this small town where his girlfriend stayed and stay on her house for a few days. We- he had planned to spend time with her, maybe going out on night together, eat things since the town was popular for their food. However, nothing had went according to plan.

Instead of warm welcoming, she don't even greet us. She was busy with work (she works home) and don't really bother to spare time for him. When we are going out, she didn't tell us anything and invited us, it turned out we went to her old friends' house. Even the next day (which was today) was like that, she said we'll go out but it was cancelled because she is lazy and the weather was hot but didn't tell us anything. We waited for a long time on the guest room like a fool.

He wanted to broke up with her.

They had been together for almost four years and had to LDR because of the covid and manage to maintain their relationship.

But after that first day, he was set on breaking up. He thinks that it won't work anymore. Moreover, after this trip ends, they probably wouldn't meet each other anymore. He'll be working back on the city we're living and she'll go to other country, working. In addition, she have traits that didn't sit my brother well. Like her likes on drinking, gambling, and eating beef meat which was not allowed in our religion (we have the same religion, my brother had been trying to dissuade her but she'll get angry being told).

He's been gloomy and acts really lethargic. When he talks to me, at least he had more energy and livelier but he had been cracking out several suicide joke (hanging his neck or falling from the roof). And being someone suicidal or having constant thought of dying myself, this had alarmed me. I wanted to grab him or something and say, ""you're not allowed to die before me.""

I'm not sure whether it's just me assuming things and being paranoid but I am not sure on what to do either. Should I just keep quite and see what happen or should I try talk something?

I used it as a way of escaping myself. On my 18th birthday I logged on an adult cam site and starting adult modeling as a transsexual in secret. I graduated high school, and went to university for a half semester before I dropped out. I fell in love with a man old enough to be my dad. He mentally abused me for 7+ months and convinced me to leave school. During this period of doing nothing and living with him, we did hard drugs together on a daily basis. The combination of cross sex hormones and random substances messed me up in ways that still affect me today. 

I found out that he was actually a pimp and preparing to start selling me. Several older transgender women that he had dealt with reached out when they heard about me. My parents hated me at this point, so I packed all my things and left to live with my best friend. I started a OnlyFans page and it blew up overnight. I got a apartment with my best friend, and slowly healed from my ex. Six months later, I moved to Los Angeles by myself. I continued doing OnlyFans and made more money then I ever imagined. I changed my legal gender and lived my dream life as a trans girl. Then it all fell apart. 

Now I’m detransitioning, and going back to being a boy. I realized I was trying to become a woman because of childhood trauma and I couldn’t do it anymore. It’s hard putting on a facade every morning, worried whether somebody will notice I’m actually a man.

I bottled everything up when I had problems and I let it destroy me. Over the years I became more and more emotionally closed off. I drank and played video games to sort of escape reality and it has taken me quite a few years to really grow up. But I have always been true to my wife, I've always stayed faithful to her. 

We married young in 2012. I was 21 and she was 20. Our first few years together were amazing, we had our daughter in 2014 and life was great. In 2015 I went to technical school to pursue a career in hvac. We also bought a house at the same time. This was obviously a very stressful time in our life, and I was very busy with school and working a part time job after school. She worked 2nd shift in a factory and we really didn't see each other much with everything we had going on. She started acting strange after a while, being distant and short with me. So I decided I would start staying up and waiting for her to get home so we could spend some time together, she was not coming home when she should have been. She was hanging out with a guy she worked with after their shift. One night she came home and asked me to shower with her. She told me she had been hanging out with this guy and she apologized and said it would never happen again. The guy called her phone while we were in the shower, so I answered it. I told him that we had talked and she told me she didn't want to lose me and that she was done with him. The next morning the bastard showed up at my house, drunk, beating the door as hard as he could. I ran out, shoved him off the porch, we had a few words and a few more shoves and then he told me that she had went to his house just a couple nights before, after work, and she had cheated on me. This of course crushed my soul and I just walked away. I made her go out and get rid of her mistake. She spent the next few days begging me to stay with her and telling me it would never happen again and that she would make it up to me. I told her I would try to forgive her but it was going to take a lot of time. And we moved on. 

In 2017 we had our son and life was going well. 

In 2018 she went to community College to pursue a career in industrial maintenance. I tried to talk her out of it of course. She's gorgeous and I was tired of her working in a factory, surrounded by men. I really wanted her to get out of the factory setting and do something different, but she was determined that was what she wanted, she enjoys fixing things and working with robotics. so I supported her decision. 
It was a co-op program where she got real work experience in the factory that picked her 3 days a week and classes the other 2. It was a very tough 2 years but we made it. After her non existent graduation due to covid, she was put into the rotating shift at work, this was very strenuous on our relationship because there would be an entire week every 3 weeks that we just didn't see each other hardly at all. It went on for about 6 months and she finally changed jobs and went to a different factory on 3rd shift. At least we got to spend a few hours together after I got off work and have dinner as a family. We had lots of ups and downs and I guess we started to drift apart somewhere in all this. 

That brings us to 2021, absolutely the worst year of our lives. 

We had a fight in March and this was the first time she told me she was unhappy, that she wanted a divorce, and that her experience with college and all the extra stuff she did, such as public speaking and appearing in news articles and advertisements for the school had changed her. (She was the first female to take and complete the course for industrial maintenance) so she got a lot of publicity. I promised her that I would do better, and we would get more time together for the two of us and we agreed to work it out. 


My wife's parents both got covid in April of 2021, they were both in the hospital within a week. This was devastating for us all, it of course made me break my promise to her that we would do more stuff just the 2 of us and go on dates, but I was there for her the whole way, her dad spent about 2 weeks in the hospital, and she was an emotional wreck the entire time. Her mom is a different story. She got worse each day, and they finally had to fly her to a very big very expensive hospital where she was pit on a ventilator and ecmo and put in a coma until she finally started to improve and woke up at the end of June. My wife's birthday was in May, it was the worst birthday of her life of course, she thought her mom was going to die, she was sure of it. She was able to be off work almost the entire time her mother was sick and she drove about 3 hours round trip almost everyday for about a month to visit her. She drove her dad to visit many times and bought whatever they needed. Did everything she possibly could for him while he was recovering. This whole thing really fucked my wife up in the head. She never talked to me about how it was messing her up, I mean I knew it hurt, we cried together many times talking about the situation and I always tried to stay positive, I always told her to be patient because her mom was im great hands with the best equipment possible to save her life. 

Fast forward to July, her mom is home and very slowly getting stronger. Her dad has been home for quite a while now and he's getting around fine. 

He apparently complained to my mother in law that my wife did too much and was too overbearing and tried to hard. This broke my wife's heart all over again. 
She didn't tell me about it until a few months later. 

In September I lost a very close family member to covid. It hurt me a lot and I really didn't talk to anyone about it. Not even my wife, she was there for me when I cried, and she was there for me the day we laid him to rest, but I thought there was no point in talking about it, he's gone, what is talking going to do? 


Fast forward to October. 

She got a day shift position that opened up, I thought this was going to help our relationship a ton. Things seemed to be going well for us. 


We're on a little weekend getaway for Halloween and she's acting super weird and distant. Won't talk to me, won't sleep in the same bed with me in, slept in a different part of the cabin. I confronted her to figure out what was going on. 
She freaked out on me, told me she was done with me and she wanted a divorce. She told me all that she had been through with her parents had changed her and that I didn't know her anymore, and that the last straw was me not opening up after my cousin died. Told me she had been talking to a guy from work for a few weeks and she really liked him. It felt like she stabbed me right in the heart. I broke down and begged her not to leave me, not to break up our little family. She told me she had made up her mind and that she was done. I told her I wasn't going to give up until I was served divorce papers. The next few weeks went by and we had of course stopped having sex because she was done with me, I was doing everything I could to try to change her mind, and we we getting along despite the situation. Then there was a death in her family, she wasn't remotely close to, but her dad wanted her to go to the funeral. She got a few days off from because it was her dads birth mother. The funeral was supposed to be on a Tuesday so she had Monday and Tuesday off. The funeral ended up being that Friday. I went with her to the funeral to be there for her and she ended up wanting me to hold her hand, I thought that was a good sign. The next week she had a complete mental break, threatening to kill herself and saying that me and the kids would be better off if she were gone, and that she was a terrible person that only hurts everyone around her. Later that week I was trying to cheer her up but she was just almost in tears. Wouldn't really look ate all week. She blurted out that she had cheated on me with the guy from work, one of the days that she was off work for the funeral.  I punched a hole in the wall and walked out. 
I came back a few hours later, and we talked. She had ended things with him after she had sex with him, she found out he was on drugs. He got what he wanted anyway. 

Looking back I wish I hadn't punched wall, but I'm working on trying to keep my composure when I get dealt a shit hand. 

Fast forward a bit and we did Christmas as normal as we could, we bought each other gifts. She bought us tickets to a concert for mid January and we went about life like normal. She starts wanting to have sex with me so of course I give in to that. I start thinking she might be changing her mind about divorce, and then I find out she's talking to yet another guy from work, so I confronted her about him. We got in a fight about that just a few days before the concert so I was sure she was going to take this guy to the concert. (At this time I'm feeling extremely insecure about myself, I just feel broken, and I'm thinking that I must just not be good enough for her) she told me there was no way she would take him, she liked him but they were just talking. She wanted to go, so we went and had an amazing time. We stayed in a hotel that night and went to the mall the next day. We had a great weekend and got along really well. Since then, we're back to have sex once or twice a week, she's talking to me like normal. She's still talking to the other guy. 

Its been 4 months since she told me she wanted a divorce and she has never even tried to get a lawyer to get the process going. She doesn't want me to move out so we can separate. She wants me to sleep in our bed still. She asks me to cuddle with her sometimes. She isn't doing anything to actually get the divorce process going. This is the most confusing thing I've ever dealt with in my life. I feel absolutely pathetic for wanting to stay with her. I feel weak for still needing her. I feel broken. I stopped eating for weeks, and lost 15 pounds. I have days where  im constantly thinking about all of this, and I get myself in a bad mood and its hard for me to speak to her or even look at her, other days I just crave attention from her. 

WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

To recap, basically we've had our fair share of hard times. We've also had so much good in our time together. We have 2 amazing kids and a life we've built together over the last 10 years. She wants to divorce, but doesn't want to throw away what we have. She wants to divorce but doesn't want me gone.

TL;DR at the end. 

You’re gonna need a little bit of backstory for this. I’m the oldest child. I was a COVID graduate, the pandemic started in the middle of my senior year. Right before lockdown I got a sports injury that fucked me over pretty badly, I was on crutches for a good part of what I had of a senior year. 
That being said, I wasn’t able to do a whole lot for myself before the pandemic started and then after it started my surgery was suddenly considered an “elective surgery” so I wasn’t able to get it until restrictions loosened a little, so I couldn’t do a whole lot for myself. 
Plus just a whole lot happened that year and I wasn’t set up for adulthood success at all (my fault, not blaming anybody else). 
I graduated in June, got my surgery, learned how to walk again(went way faster than I thought it would), moved out in September(I went from needing help for almost everything to being on my own within a couple of months)  and I’ve been struggling ever since. 
I was an arts major, and I failed all of my  ONLINE classes except for those that were about the field I wanted to go into, so I dropped out. I had a good paying job but it was 6 days a week, 8-12 hours a day and I was miserable, so I quit and started jumping from job to job a little bit. I recently found a job that I like, and I graduate from academy for the trade tomorrow and I’m excited about it, but my sister who’s a junior in high school just called me and started telling me about all of her plans for the future and how everything is falling into place and I’m so proud of her, but I’m also jealous?? I don’t want to be and I don’t know how to handle it or how to get rid of the feeling. 
Not only that but as soon as I moved out my parents suddenly started being Good Parents ™ and I’m so happy for my sisters that they’re getting what I never got but I’m also hurt that now I see that my parents had the ability to change and put forth the effort, they just didn’t want to for me?? I recently had a full panic attack about this, because little me didn’t deserve the stuff she was put through(even though it’s way less than what others have gone through) but I’m also glad that my younger sisters don’t have to go through as much as I did. (My dad has apologized about how they treated me to me, without me bringing it up, but I’m not sure my mom even knows I was effected by any of what happened)

It sucks that I graduated almost two years ago and I’m still struggling to just be a person but they seem like they’re being set up for success and becoming well rounded people, and I’m just here by myself not knowing how to fix myself. (My family is helping me financially and it’s not like they don’t talk to me, but that makes me feel even worse for being so jealous)
Sorry for the rambling, I’m a lil upset and I don’t know what to do.

So they fired us so we can collect unemployment. Unfortunately unemployment isn't enough for me. 

Here's my situation. I was a granite installer and Damm good at it. I was making $19 an hour and about to demand a raise as I, and my coworkers, think I'm worth more. Since I'm currently laid off though that is going to have to wait. I have a prospect for a job doing granite and other construction for potentially $30. I'm waiting to hear back from the guy as he was super busy this week. Obviously if he responds and puts me to work that's the route I'm going to go. 

In the mean time I've been pumping my resume out like crazy and have gotten a lot of bites. At this point I have a tile company wanting to bring me on as a tile setter for $15 an hour, a brick Mason wanting me for $16 an hour, and a airduct cleaner for $18. I also have an interview coming up with a skiresort as a dishwasher. Now I know that doesn't match the other jobs but hear me out; snowboarding is my winter passion. It's what I look forward to all year and once the snow starts falling I'm looking for every opportunity to hit the slopes. Unfortunately my favorite mountain to ride is extremely expensive --unless you work there. Full time employees make about $14 an hour and get free season passes plus the restaurant I applied for requires you to ski in and out so it's a win. 

I'm really considering this ski resort because I would save a ton of money ($110 per day spent boarding up there) plus be able to pay my bills during this season and then I could return to my granite installing. 

I just don't know if I'm being dumb here? I'm 22 and on one hand want to make money and get out of debt and into financial security, but I also have a desire to enjoy myself and reep the rewards of my grind (snowboarding). 

Again, if the guy gets back to me and offers me the $30 like we discussed then the ski resort will have to wait until next year because that kind of money would change my life.

We became friends pretty quick and talked 1-2 per week, but 2-3 months later we started talking less presumably because we were too busy. 

But on our last exchange, i remember us talking about if how i were to ever go to his country for vacation that i should hit him up straight away. So many months passed as we did our own thing and he slipped off my mind. Until about a month ago, when my parents decided we go on vacation somewhere, i suggested we visit the country he was in without hesitation. They agreed and i was ecstatic ab it. So i sent him a message saying “hey i’m planning a trip to your country around june and i’m extremely excited about it! would you be down to meet up when i’m there? bla bla bla” He basically replied, “yes of course, i’ll definitely be down to meet” and i said smth like “no problem, i’ll hit you up again when i have to plan for the itinerary”. 

So fast forward again to yesterday, my mum had been pestering me to start planning for the itinerary (i wanted to plan for the trip with him) so i sent him a message again saying:
“Hey you down for a short call today?”
“I’m down, what time do you have in mind?”
“Oh i’m actually free anytime now! Maybe in 1hr? Haha”
“I have a meeting then, maybe 2 hours from now?”
“I might be having lunch then so just hit me up anytime after your meeting and i’ll lyk!”
(No response)

So 2pm was the time and i had lunch really quick so i could prepare for the call. And then i waited. And waited. 2pm. He was always punctual for our meetings. (maybe cause we were both on holiday last year) but then 4pm came and i felt the meeting should have long ended already. So i messaged him, “any plans for today? If not i’ll get on with other stuff” and he immediately replied, “sorry man, this meeting is taking forever. Maybe let’s try tomorrow?” I said, “okay tomorrow works! Good luck with your meetingg” (no response). 

I felt sick the entire day cause i sensed/am sensing that the same thing is gonna happen today again and i feel awful. Like somehow the desire to travel just disappeared like that. 

How am i supposed to feel? Did i do something wrong? Was i over-enthusiastic about meeting him? Am i over-exaggerating? Should i message him again today or just wait for his reply?

The thing is that I have a low weight and i still want to lose some more. It's a long story how I got to this point, but in short: i was a bit overweight.

I don't have any money to go to the gym so I do workouts at home. I try to build muscles, but because my eating habits are fucked, i can't. 

And this obsession with food, steps and workouts is taking over my life. If i don't walk at least 15k i feel guilty. If i go above a certain amount of calories, I feel guilty. It's an endless groundhog day. And i already feel how my low weight affects my productiveness. I am much weaker than before. I am always ill with some sort of cold. I freeze constantly.

I have everything: university for which i ripped my ass to get there, shitton of plans for the future: job, internships, travels. And it all seems to go ass backwards because of this.

I would stay up late to help read her assignments. I even drove 45 minutes for her to go to her pinning ceremony. I felt as if I was willing to do anything for our friendship.

I'm currently one week from turning 18 and my life is at its lowest point, undoubtedly. For starters, my gf broke up with me a few months ago and my self esteem is shattered. I have 0 self respect and thus the problem became much bigger than it should've become and i also lost most of my friends. I don't even have anyone to invite to my birthday party anymore so i guess I'll have to spend my 18th birthday alone.

 To make things worse, school is not going great. My grades are not bad at all, but they could be a bit higher to make sure i pursue the career i ambition, and my parents are becoming very uneasy about it. I don't mean to blame it on them, as it is my fault only i have gotten to this point, but they can be quite controlling and explosive when i get a ""bad"" grade. I once scored an 18/20 and they got pretty fucking mad. Well, i have a 16 coming tomorrow and they're going to speak to my math teacher.  I don't know what to do.

 I'm aware i should put more effort in school but i can't concentrate on anything. I always revert to dwelling on the past and I'm only at peace when listening to music or indulging in other types of media, because reality is just too painful. My parents also threatened to take away all my guitars which are pretty much my only source of happiness.

I’ve been trying to break into the international relations field with a focus on China (I realized my interest in this field rather late, prior to this I was a general IR student without a focus). 

Since graduating, I delayed full-time employment so I can seek out internship opportunities that would benefit me. I finished an internship with the Asia Society in December for example. I’ve also been taking Chinese lessons at an institute nearby. 

I’m 24 years old, and applying to graduate school next fall. I have been looking for full time work since I finished my internship, and was planning on working during the day and doing classes at night for grad school. I’m in my mid-twenties, and feel deepening anxiety about securing full-time employment. I have a second round interview with the accounting firm EY tomorrow, actually. 

The thing is, I was also just accepted into an immersion program for Chinese at the Middlebury Language School for this summer. An 8 week program. I know I will likely not be able to work full time if I get a job if I plan on doing this program. No job will give me 8 weeks off, especially as a new employee. But I really think this program will help my fluency and be beneficial for the future. 

I don’t know what to do. Do I delay getting a full-time job even longer to do this program? Do I not do the program and run the risk of potentially not even finding a job? Do I put it off and reapply in the future?

Whatever we had earlier is crazily complicated . We never liked each other (really) but were too much interested in each other . What I really feel about that person is .... His wife would be really lucky but I dont feel bad about it . I want to see him just once , I don't know why . This person is just too much focused on his career and I really admire this .   
So , right now the situation is like Im 18 and im home for really a few months and all set to go to college which is far away and after that my future is nowhere even close to the place im from , neither culturally nor geographically . In short , these are just last few months Im here . People meet old people on dating apps like Tinder and all that but there is no chance that i'll ever use them . On Instagram , I know that person's username and he knows mine but I'll never send him request and i don't think he'll ever . See , tbh , I don't want much . I just want to see him once from a distance . Nope , I don't want to make any relationship , any friendship , I don't want to talk to him , I don't even want to make an eye contact or smile at him or anything like this . Honestly , Im past everyone and everything now . I just don't know Why I want this to happen !

Why do you think I want to see him before leaving this place ? Is this natural ?

 I usually use this account for asking about such problems, my profile is filled with these posts, but this specific question, this mystery has haunted me ever since i had this realisation in elementary school. I've tried to be as entertaining as possible, i've tried to act like i don't care, i've tried to be cool but nothing ever works. I've tried both opposites: being extremely invested in the relationship, and the conversation, listening to what they're trying to say etc and being totally aloof from the people and the conversation both of them have the same result.

 Some of you might say that the people around me are just jerks but you can't call literally every single person I've met in my life a jerk? Cause that has been the exact case all my life, every. single. person. literally. I try to act like maybe this isn't a big deal but it really really affects me. Imagine this: one day you wake up and no one takes you seriously, even when you say the right thing, you try to talk to people but they give the most robotic, formal replies that and the conversation right there, no one wants to talk to you, even when you approach them, tbh i can tolerate loneliness but not being respected by everyone  when you have given nothing but respect to them and have done no such thing that might be disrespectful or something that they stop respecting you over, feels awful. I don't even need to do anything for this to happen, i could just be sitting in a corner, minding my own business but somehow even my existence annoys people.

I’m doing Sports Business Management in Scotland and in my third year of university I can go to America to study for a year and have a better shot at American Football. The only thing is that obviously I still have the rest of year 1 and year 2 in Scotland before then and that’s a long time away. I used to be very passionate about it and had my mind set on American Football or the Sports and Fitness industry for a career but I’ve always had the lingering thought in the back of my head for 2 years now about the Royal Marines. 

With the Marines I know the training is hard etc but after that getting to travel the world and all of the life experience you would gain from it too while also earning money focusing on one thing that I would love. I just don’t want to seem like I’m throwing all my hard work away but I really am unsure nowadays and have been thinking about the Marines more and more for the last month.

A few days ago my mom called me, pretty much in a nut shell saying how my girl friend posted some tiktok and made it sound terrible, end of the world, etc. She also mentioned that my dad was also ashamed. Pretty much at the end she said I should ""reassess"" who my girlfriend is. I didn't see the tiktok, but after this weird phone call I decided to look for myself. It is **literally** a short video with a clip that says near the middle of it, ""suck my dick you stupid b\*\*\*\*"". This was literally the tiktok video that my mom was referring to.

&amp;#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong, we have all heard, ""Watch what you post on the internet, it could come creeping up back at you."" But come on, this is TikTok. I have seen many cringy inappropriate videos on it, did any of those people end up failing in life cause of it? Most likely not. 

  
I can see why they have their opinions on the video but come on. Are you really gonna hate my girlfriend over a short tiktok? I almost feel like they are attacking her over it. It sucks cause I am in college and everything just kinda feels like it is attacking me at once.

My girlfriend is talking to them about it and everything, and told me to worry about school and not on the drama. But I just can't get it out of my head.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I've moved out of my parents house 6 months ago now, and therefore I guess I'm an independent grown up, and I've noticed that I have become a lot more serious, which to be completely honest is not something I'm happy about, I feel like I'm taking life too seriously and not as excited over things (for example, meeting girls, after some bad situations I find that I do not let myself get excited as to not let myself get hurt). 

Also, things that were fun when new have become chores (cooking was fun for a bit and now I do it to survive)

So my question/advice needed is from other ""grown ups"", what do you think growing up means, Is this lack of excitement just a bi-product of getting older, and if not what can I do to change it.

Is growing up just having responsibilities and having less freedom in that regard (I.E. not beyong able to fuck off and play Halo for the next 3 months because rent, growth or whatever).

When I was younger I tried studying Business Administration but also fell in a pretty dark place, I had no energy to do anything or concentrate. First year, through sheer force of will, I passed everything, with top marks/honorary mentions etc, but I was getting burned out. 

Second year, passed everything but 1 subject, still some excellent grades in some even, but I felt like it was getting to be too much. I couldn't tell you what exactly was ""too much"" but I felt like I couldn't keep up with anything.

 My parents suggested it was better for me (and cheaper) to do less subjects but keep grades up, so I only did like 70% courseload the 3rd year. passed half of that. In the middle of that I moved out with my gf and took a part time job to sustain myself. This is when I feel things really went downhill for me, I was already feeling out of control and slipping in all my duties (college grades, prospects, jobs...) and was always moody and extremely tired, between studying and working.

I don't regret moving out or my relationship, I was euphoric and it was a very needed boost that I thought at the time would get me out of the funk I was feeling. I would have crashed sooner without them to be sure, but they delayed the inevitable, not avoided it.

I hated what I was studying, couldn't see the point of it, so I dropped out and went to work full-time. I felt a sense of relief that I no longer had to put time into something I had grown to hate but afterwards I just felt empty, always, all the time. I wasn't sad but I also wasn't happy or excited, just null.error

\*For context, where I live its pretty difficult to get a job without a bachelors, and even with one its difficult. I once worked at a fast food chain and my coworker was doing a master in physics (he already had degree then) and said he was struggling to find something better.

I knew I wasn't going anywhere without a bachelors, but I was burned out and the thought of going back to uni made me hyperventilate and feel dizzy. I figured if I couldn't get a bachelors, that i would used what I had done and get an Associates of marketing, I managed to get that done in a year while working. 

Afterwards I Found a better job at a EU project to analyze and predict traffic safety and interventions with multiple sources, this was a 3 year project and once it finished we would all be out on the streets. To build a model, that fed on police reports, hospital data, social media mentions, insurance statistics.). I really liked it and I learned a TON.

Anyway, job ended, it was a bit of a blow, I really liked it, but knew this was coming from day 1.

My girlfriend had to go back to her home country to attend to family emergency and business and then the pandemic happened and we couldn't fly to see each other due to restrictions. Long distance ended up being the end of that. Good try though and good breakup with 0 resentment/blame.

&amp;#x200B;

I still missed her, still felt dizzy and clueless about what I wanted to do with my life and figured ""if you don't know where you are going, any road will take you there"", so I applied to a bunch of jobs without much thought. I ended up in a temp contract in sales to cover an illness. I wasn't thrilled, but at least I was out of the house and had something to do.

Sales is NOT for me, managers made it a habit to scream at people (I was lucky I only got yelled at once, department record actually) and one even threw his mouse at a senior coworker because our team was second in the performance rankings (from the top, we were second best for the first month in the entire year, we had dominated before that).

I wanted to quit and my contract was running out anyway, my boss actually did me a solid and fired me so I'd have extra unemployement days than simply waiting another 2 weeks for the contract to expire. 

I have like 8 moths of unemployment I haven't tapped into yet, so while not swimming in money my situations isn't dire by any means.

&amp;#x200B;

**So here I am now, 27, unemployed and with 0 clues of what to do. Sales taught me that I shouldn't just go after another jobs just because, but I truly have no clue where to go from here or what to do**.

Rationally I know I should get a job, go back to school, get/finish a bachelor, get in shape, and go back to dating, fall in love, stablish a house, further my career etc. 

I should, as my mother puts it, ""finally get your life together and make something of yourself"".

**The problem is, I have no clue of what I want, in part because I don't want anything**. excitement, desire, even sadness, left me long ago. I simply exist and that is enough of a challenge most days, simply going through the motions of showering, dressing, doing groceries and scouring the internet...for what?

Life feels overwhelming most days, I want to sleep my days away but I know that is unhealthy and won't help me, I am not getting any younger after all :)

I don't even know how to start figuring it out, the only thing I feel reliably is guilt and stress. I feel like in a videogame, I dodged rolled to avoid a killing blow only to roll myself off a cliff and die to fall damage, or worse, glitch through the map in an endless fall.

Reddit, how do I figure out what to do? How can i manage so things don't feel overwhelming and pointless?

Currently, I'm in Canada to study (and obviously to obtain PR for a better life). I have a boyfriend back in Indonesia, he's planning to come here to study as well this Fall. 

For some reason, I don't feel right being here. I ended up dropping out from my courses and now I'm contemplating going back to Indonesia and replan for the future. The thing is, my immigration agent has been pushing me to stay and reapply for another college, taking a one-year program so I can apply for PR after graduating right away. I feel like partly, he's right that I should stay because life won't treat me kindly back in Indonesia. But partly, I feel like I'm being used, they'll get more money if I apply to this other college. Besides, I'm not sure how worth it to take this one-year post-degree program anyway.

My boyfriend has been nothing but supportive in any decision I made, but he wants me to make a decision. It's been a month, and I've been acting like a metronome, literally going back and forth in my decision. 

If I have to write down the pros and cons, I guess staying is the safer option right? I'm here, I just need to survive studying for a year and graduate, then I'll apply for PR (the agent said I have more than a 50% chance of getting it).  My boyfriend will be here soon, we'll be free to be ourselves here.

If I'm going back, I have already done several interviews for jobs in Indonesia. We're planning to move to the Netherlands instead. I've lived in France for 2 years and I loved it there, so could it be a cultural thing? I have friends all around Europe, and I have my cat staying with my french friend too. But the problem would be the language and it will be more difficult to obtain a PR in Europe.

Everyone told me to just stay here. I've done every trick suggested to me to make a decision. The closest I was to make a decision was flipping a coin. I know I don't want the result to be staying here. But it just feels so illogical.

I feel like my boyfriend is right. There is no wrong decision for this. But my life would branch so differently with each choice I made. I don't want to disappoint him, I love him so much, and I want to make the right decision for us. But I just, can't make a firm decision.

I don’t want anyone to worry about that. I’m just miserable. 

I (f23) feel completely lost. I still live with my parents and work at a dead end job that I despise with a passion. I’m drinking way to much because it’s one of the only things that makes me happy and all I do when I’m not at work is sit around because everything feels so empty. I want to do things so badly but I can’t make myself get up and do them (I know that doesn’t make sense.). 

I graduate at the top of my class in high school, I used to draw, read, write, have fun, but I don’t do that anymore. Everyone around me has a job or is getting married or is starting a family. And here I am still living with my mom and dad. I do help pay the bills, so I’m not a complete deadbeat anymore, but I defiantly was for a while and I despise myself for it. 

God knows I’ve never been in an actual relationship. At this point I feel like I’m to inexperienced for anyone to want me anyway.

I flunked out of college because I was going to end it all, but I couldn’t even do that so now I’m stuck in debt and couldn’t go back even if I wanted to. 

I feel like I’m still a child. I get patronized by most of my family (not my parents) and I feel like a deserve it but I still hate it. Anytime I try to enjoy something it’s probably a kids media (Disney movies, cartoons, video games, etc.). Usually something from my childhood, which was more or less okay. I found out some messed up stuff about my family when I got older, but I don’t think my childhood was traumatizing enough to warrant me being stuck in it or whatever (I don’t know if that makes sense. I’m not good at describing things). 

I really don’t have any friends. Not anymore anyway. Everyone is busy with their own lives and they don’t have time anymore. I’m not mad at them about it. I could reach out and I’m sure a few would like to hear from me, but we’re in such different places in life I feel like common ground would be harder to find. 

I’m miserable all the time, can’t do things that I would probably enjoy, my attention span is ruined, I don’t have any adult interests, I feel like I have no way out. I don’t know how to fix myself.

Since I was young I was academically gifted, securing honours with distinction (90+) every year of my life, athletically gifted as the captain of my basketball team and school sports star, as well as being generally well put together. On top of this I was a socialite and often attracted the room’s attention. 

I say that to help contrast my recent experiences. I feel lost. I have no motivation, socially I’m dying at the most competitive high school in Canada, my grades have dropped down to low 90s max and 85 at the lowest, which is distressing because I want to attend a top university (ivy, or prestigious). All of my motivation in the past was internally derived which means that I have crashed really bad. I have a serious porn and gaming addiction (orgasm maybe 3 times a day, up to 7-10 sometimes | 15-20 league matches a day). I procrastinate so badly that I’ve had an 89 percent sealed in for sem 1, which is devastating to me. It doesn’t sound like it is, but I’m holding on to so little that seeing my self continue to slip shows no bottom to where I can fall. This is my most important year of schooling for university and I feel like a fuck up. I still need to win competitions but I don’t believe I can do them. I underestimate myself constantly and over procrastinate to cope (if I fail then I didn’t try anyways, and if I succeed then I’m good enough regardless). I’ve started lying to my mother, telling her that I’ve finished the 6 month late assignments and on my report card it’ll be fixed. On top of this I keep thinking if there’s a chance to die, I’d take it. Like there’s no way to reform my former potential, so I might as well just finish here. I wouldn’t commit suicide but it most definitely starts off with these thoughts of wanting death to come. I feel like there’s a lot I should live up to with everything that I’ve been gifted. I have to make a lot of money to keep some fucking promise, and earn a lot of prestige to make up for these years of my life. I don’t know anymore. Every time I try to do something I just give in and watch porn, or I’ll succeed and go on a work spree for a little, then relapse in celebration of success which is the only thing keeping my life afloat. Im barely hanging on, I have barely any friends, my grades are dropping, I don’t practice in basketball as often, im breaking promises, I’m objectifying women, I cry at night, slump my back, and I have began considering a less expectant way of life. Like drugs or just being homeless

I’ve also become seriously racist. I’m black and I scapegoat all of east Asia and Europe for my problems. More intensely and specifically East Asians, as I live in Canada (where racism towards black people from Asian people is very common) and have experienced racism from them my whole life. Lots of situations where I felt as though I’m an outcast, but I was strong enough to not let it get to me. But it’s really affecting me now. The white racism is an obvious. 

Finally, I keep looking back on the past and romanticizing it. Those to me were the best days of my life. Specifically g9. I met a girl that I thought I fell in love with (I’m starting to reconsider with the acknowledgment of my recreational viewing of the past). My best friends were amazing, and my school life was too. I didn’t watch porn, I didn’t game, and I was the most productive I’ve ever been. I was on sports team after sports team, and did very well. I received readers awards, CTS awards, and academic awards, along with graduating top of my year. And immediately when quarantine hit, things changed for me. That was generally the start of a first little spiral down, but I recovered. I started to do great things, taking advantage of the time. Then school came in, and after I wrote a bad assignment and did mediocre, I reconsidered a whole lot. I think that’s when I started romanticizing my past, with the belief that I had made the wrong choice to go to such a competitive and prestigious high school.

Due to the length of this. I’ll end it off here. With one last problem I’m experiencing.

Due to the internalized racism towards East Asians and white people, I hold. I believe I’ve started to revel in the imaginative scenes of African diaspora uprisings and revival. Essentially the idea of the creation of an empire and purifying of Africa. 

TL;DR:

I am a black Hitler, w/ low self respect, esteem, value, and a deprecated motivation. I’ve lost social abilities and indulge in racist fantasies and “copium” frequently. I have no one to keep me going because I was the one to before, and I’m in a cycle of self deterioration, and will most likely eventually crash until that’s it. I’ll be done. Probably willing to and will commit suicide.

I’m extremely worried I’m wasting it and can’t sort out what the heck I’m supposed to do with it.

There’s so many amazing things in this world, so many fantastic people, places, and possible experiences. Yet, I can’t seem to sort any of it out. I’m 26, I have had to move back home after dropping out of college for the third time, I work a dead end job, I have no friends around me, and I just feel so stagnant. I take medication to help with my anxiety and see a therapist weekly. I’m trying to make things happen but they never work.

How can I be struggling so much to enjoy life when it can be so wonderful for others? Sure, there will be struggles, but I can’t seem to get past my own. I’m not as anxious as I once was and I’m at least getting out of the house these days, but I feel like I’m going to be stuck just getting by, passing the time away until I die.

Every time I’ve tried to make changes (a job, school again, moving to a new place) it has resulted in me breaking down and ending up back home. At this point it’s basically a family joke. Im tired of it but don’t see a way for it to change. Despite knowing there can be beauty in this world and I can enjoy it and make it better for myself and others… I can’t put together any of the pieces to make it so.

And I’ve tried sorting out what to do but it gets too confusing. I get overwhelmed by the limitless possibilities in front of me. How can I justify spending more time on myself versus helping others, or spending time with this person over that person? How can I put more time in a hobby when I could actually learn more skills to improve my job prospects? How can I sort any of that out? It doesn’t make sense to me.

Basically… I don’t know what to believe anymore. And I think it’s good I’m not fully indoctrinated and closed-minded, but at the same time, I’m so open to new ideas that I have no foundation from which to build my life. I can change things on a whim, crashing into one thing after another. It’s terribly frustrating to deal with.

Our landlord is selling the house and my family is low income. I'm 28 but live with Elderly parents helping to support my disabled sister.

She's really important to my mental health BUT I don't have ESA papers for her and in California you need to have a therapist for a month and then have them file paperwork. I almost bought fake esa papers but had an anxiety attack thinking the landlord would be smarter than that. 

I was previously in an emotionally and financially abusive relationship where I never owned or drove a car bc she didn't feel it was important (I know, I shouldn't have listened). So I don't even have the option of living in a car because I don't have a license. I was working towards it (getting documents, studying, some behind wheel time) but now with everything going on there hasn't been time.

If I lose my job which is looking likely then no one in the household has a full time job and we won't qualify for any apartments or housing. I'm overwhelmed.

 My friend wants me to move in with her. I can bring my dog, rent would be mostly just my utilities and food and her work is willing to hire me (less physical job) . However, I would be abandoning my elderly parents and sister. Without me they won't qualify for a place. My mother wants me to try and salvage my job and just deal with the pain, rehome the dog. She says best bet is put everything in storage and camp (at a campground not just in someone's yard) near my work until we find a place.  The housing market is messed up. Last place I spoke to told me they got over a thousand applications.

I can either stay with my family to help them through being homeless which means losing my dog and trying to work pushing heavy boxes with an injury or abandon my family but have a place to live, my dog, and a job that hurts less. Her motivation is that we both bake, she runs a from home bakery and is going to school to learn culinary  business stuff to open a bakery. Right now she also works part time at a cave that does tours and can get me a job there. Feels like everyone wants something from me and And I hate that it's all on me. I'm being pulled in two directions and both sides try to say the other side will ruin my life.

On top of all this my Grandmother has Alzheimer's and they just took her license away but she won't stop driving. She lives with my uncle but he does hard drugs and takes off for days at a time, is in and out of prison, etc. We wanted to rent a house big enough for her to move in with us but we had been under the impression from the landlord that we would have another year here up until a couple weeks ago. 

This whole thing is a mess and I feel trapped on all sides. It's so bad that I wish I was still with my ex who would spend all my money then tell me it was my fault, including personal loans I got for my dental care (which I never got and am now missing teeth). At least with her I always had a place to live.

I'm tired and scared and conflicted. It feels like I'm a monster if I abandon my family but at the same time I can't keep hurting my shoulder and losing my dog feels like putting a kid up for adoption. I actually had some scary self harming thoughts the other day (I am not currently a danger) and I know my mental health will not hold up if I become homeless.


I don't know where to start. I'm on medical leave until the 2nd and I spend all day calling apartments, worrying, and arguing with my family while my friend sends me texts about how much she loves her job and how she would help me get on my feet. 

Why is the world like this? My sister's disability payments are a joke, my dad makes under a thousand a month from social security. My mom works for in home health services for the elderly and her last full time client DIED so she's only working part time. I'm 28, mentally ill with chronic pain and a motor skill dysfunction and it's supposed to be my job to support them? I'm trying but something has to change. 


Tl;dr: Became the primary breadwinner for my parents and sister following divorce from abusive ex. Now we face probable homelessness. I have a friend offering me and my dog a room and a physically  easy job but that leaves my family without my help.

Balance your work and school as well as you can. Aim for high 80's to low 90's (in grades), STEM Is important. DONT FUCK UP YOUR GPA WITH GYM OR SMTH U HATE. Don't over work yourself, thats a recipie for disaster.

Go to a uni/college you like, but also will help you with getting a carreer. While some aim for ivy league schools, go where you want.

Get a bank account, and save up. student loans in uni/college will hit you like a truck. If possible, let your parents pay for schooling. 

Inisially go to a job that pays well, where you work on your dream job as a hobby. when you are ready, move on to your dream job. And remember life is about happyness, not money.

If your a family type person, dont rush into marrige, wait until you found the person. When/if you have kids, then your main goal isnt happiness any more, but taking care of your children, while not being COMPLETLEY DEPRESSED. 

By yourself, live where you want and can afford, with a family live where your kids will grow up happy.

If your an animal person, MAKE SURE PETS ARE ALLOWED WHERE YOU LIVE/ WHERE YOU GO TO SCHOOL.

Learn as much as you can, as young as you can. Aim for speaking English, Spanish, Japaneese, Mandarain, or any language that seems important. Aim for knowing at least 2 langueages fluently.

For folks who like traveling, travel a lot, but only when you can afford it. Plan properly. Take everyhting into consiteration.

I’ll try my best to give some context because I really suck at story telling (thanks ADHD). 

I’m a 22 year old that just graduated college with a business degree. Over the last year, my parents have been closely hovering over me to make life altering decisions I didn’t even want (Opening up a company in my name I never wanted, buying a new truck when I didn’t even consider the option nor had the desire to but “it’s for the business, you need it.” “You won’t be making as much money working for someone else.”)

Most times than not, idk wtf I’m doing and it really frustrates me because the people who basically led me into this kind of work don’t want to give advice or help when I need it, but the second they need a favor they need it right away. Fair enough, they’re my parents so I understand I gotta do it. But I don’t like holding up customers for 3+ weeks just because I need clarification that YouTube or the internet isn’t giving and my parents basically push me off to help “later” until I’m visibly irritated and heated. 

I really don’t feel like this job is meant for me despite how good the pay can be. Arguments arise and I always get gaslighted to the point I can’t remember why my feelings were valid and/or justifiable. “What have you done?! You’ve done nothing! Why are you always angry? It’s because you do nothing to contribute.” I just can’t remember any instance in the moment to help me reply with an answer, but it would be brushed off anyways so what would be the point? I just keep hearing “you good for nothing.”

More than my career, I’m just trying to find balance in myself and feel like I’m finding some direction in my life but this constant build up of anger and depression is making me more emotional whenever I’m alone and I’m tired of exploding over it. I feel like I just let them change my whole character and now I don’t even have an idea of what I’d like to be or try to do. 

Idk, should I just drop what I have with them just grind working, and move out asap? I’m tired of facing the toxicity at home and don’t want to be part of the problem any longer.

So I am a Swedish student and currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at a Swedish university, and would I love to try study abroad in South Korea as an exchange student for 1 semester or 2 (since I'm really interested in the food, culture, music, etc.), but I'm also afraid if I would be able to handle the extreme competitive pressure over there which worries me whether I should do it or not?

Have anyone here (from a western background) studied in South Korea and can share their experiences?

Because studying engineering in Sweden is almost hard enough for me, with lot's of readings, assignments and exams to do all the time non stop, but at the same time - Sweden is not so competitive at all when it comes to social pressure and getting high grades (most Swedish Engineering students have a surviving/passing E grade mentality which is enough in our society), which makes me think - would I be able to handle the more extreme competitive pressure and expectations at a south korean university if I already think that Engineering in Sweden is almost too much? I would love to do it just to get a chance to travel, study abroad, get new experiences and try to live in South Korea for a while, but I'm hesitant at the same time because I'm afraid that it might be too much for me after I have read in how much South Korean university students suffer because of the competitive pressure.

Longer version:

So there is this one dude, lets call him A. Mr.A is a teen just like me and my girlfriend. Mr A and my GF have been friends for 2 years now. But his introduction to me was a negative one.

 My first time seeing anything about him is flirting with my girlfriend. Now usually when friends are close they can flirt and i dont mind that. But she herself said ""we aren't close at all"" and from what i can say she had to say that she had a boyfriend for him to stop. She has a problem of standing up for herself due to fear of loosing people stuff like that. She then said that he is: overly sensitive, always makes her uncomfortable, is a huge liar.

So i met him, talked with him and he seemed okay so i thought it was forgiveable. But then he decided to say this ""maple is my bestfriend!"" i was like just out man, he doesn't even know her actual bestfriend. okay okay maybe he is a bit out there idk. But then he dropped this ""dont mind if i call maple 'babe' okay? im gay dw"" and then i just deep inside lost my chill. I didn't do anything but man was i pissed off at him. So we continue talking and out of the hundreds of stories he could tell me he chooses to tell me a story that was sure to make me jealous, and it seemed intentional. 

So afterwards she sends me something new, a screenshot of their dms, mr.A making sexual comments on a fanart of a character in front of my girlfriend, saying exactly ""mommy cum smack my ass like a drumm (insert weird sexual emoji idk)""  which made her uncomfortable. And lastly literally today he ""accidentally"" sent her hentai \[it was yaoi\] like and said ""let me teach you how to play the trumpet"" then literally explained how to give a blowjob to her. She obviously was uncomfortable talking with someone that is not me about anything sexual. She literally said ""im just done, take me away \[kill me\]"" . This was the wake up call for me to go ask others.

Before i present the question a few things to note:                                                                                                                    He has no idea it makes her uncomfortable because one time my gf stood up for herself he played the victim card and she has been scared to stand up ever since in fearing of loosing someone, in her own words ""I cant lose anyone anymore i am lonely as is, so its fine \[mr.A's actions\]""                                           I used to be manipulative and stuff and i am fearing if i am being too controlling about saying negative stuff about her 2 year long friend and how she should confront him, we have only been dating for a few months.                                                                                                                                               He thinks they are literal best friends, aka He thinks they are bestfriends and he is gay so its okay to do this stuff.

So reddit do you think its worth confronting about? Or am i just over reacting to this. What if its just nothing big and im making a huge fuss about it? am i controlling saying she should confront him and stuff?? and should it go beyond just confronting?.

I am fortunate enough to have all those, 
Well paid job, sports car, my first home, and a mortgage that is no worry. 

But I am sitting on the side of my bed, thinking. What the hell do I do now? What else is there to aim for. 
I've tried dating. Met someone amazing, but honestly, I don't want to settle. So broke things off. 

I'm not ready to settle and stop, but I don't know what else to aim for?
I feel confused, lost, I want to achieve something else by 30, but I have no idea what?

I'm looking for some advice.

I'm going through one of those bouts right now.  
In the past being depressed for me looked like daily panic attacks and feeling inconsolable and sleeping more than anyone ever should.  I haven't been medicated since 2016 and I'm proud of that.  

I'm going through an overdue divorce (amicable thankfully that's not been bothering me) and an engagement (my fiance is not the problem either, he is wonderful) on top of the pandemic.  I don't have the energy to clean much and I've not had a job for over a year.  

Fiance says I don't have to have a job, but not generating income is eating at me.  Our house needs work both structurally and new ducting for the furnace.  My car has been in the shop for over a year now - so it would be complicated for me to take a full time job at a brick and mortar, anyway.  Fiance wants me to paint and work on my novel but I just don't have the mental space.  I barely have the mental capacity to feed and water myself and our animals and take myself to the bathroom, anymore.  Most days are wasted watching YouTube.  

I feel so guilty.  I hate it that my fiance works so hard and comes home to a messy and half finished house.  I know what needs done and I know how to do it but I just don't know how to allocate the funds to fix everything that needs fixing.  If fiance had the salary he makes now, in early 2020, we could have afforded to fix things but now, we can barely make ends meet.  I feel even more guilty that my fiance hasn't gone off on me for not keeping the house clean.  I keep waiting for it but it doesn't happen.  His patience with me just makes me feel so much worse, on the days I have an even harder time to just try and keep myself focused on anything.

I swear the fact that the house is in the state it is, is why I feel so uninspired, overwhelmed, and just gross emotionally.  

I want to beat myself up over this.  I know I shouldn't because I can't get myself stuck in the downward spiral that would send me to the psych unit, again. I keep catching myself in negative thoughts or habits and I don't like it. I try everyday to stay positive but I feel like if something doesn't change, I'm going to be back to the psych ward.  I really don't want that.  Something needs to change but I just don't know what to do or where to start.   I don't like the person that I am right now.

What my goal in life is, is to become some sort of figure for any sort of community/people/etc. in something I love.
For me (I feel bad saying this cause everyone says it's unrealistic and impossible), I want to become one of the great esports players. I want to be remembered as the one who went from being told I couldn't do it, and did it anyways.
To sort of become a figure for the fans or others who want to do the same or something similar.

Because I've been told (through sources other than my parents) that if you have a dream you should go for it no matter what everyone says.
I just have a lot of anxiety I guess about it not being possible.
Maybe I'm not good enough?
Maybe I just don't have enough time to do that?
Maybe I'm wrong in trying to quote ""waste [my] time"" with this dream?

I wonder if anyone here knows anything about this.
I really want (and if I think about it, I even *need*) it to happen.
Mostly just because I don't have anything else I want to do in life.
I don't want to just pursue my suggested career in some barely interesting job and just ""go through life"" for the rest of my own.

I want to make a mark and be a figure for ones might be in the same boat or situation.
I have fear it's just not going to happen.
I mean, my friends all support me, but when your own family thinks you're ridiculous, you don't have much hope.
Im not going to give up because I have nothing else to shoot for that I want this bad.

In an essence I feel like it might just be a waste of time.

Let me start from the beginning. 


I met this wonderful, wonderful girl. And she was amazing. And I fucked it all up because I am a fucking ass hole who ruined everything.

I don't joke around when I say this girl was amazing.

She literally knew me by looking at me.

She knew how I felt within hours of meeting me.

She knew what I did when I was stressed, or overthinking, or mad, or anxious.

And I really, really liked her.

I'm the stereotypical fat kid, writes fanfiction, listens to music all the time, constantly wanting to change but never doing it because I would chicken out.

So imagine my happiness when we started dating.

And I tried opening up to her and now we don't talk. 

I fucked it all up being stupid. Stupid me just pushing and pushing and PUSHING and now the ONE fucking person who actually liked me for who I was is GONE 

And it broke me.


I don't want to eat, I don't want to drink, I don't want to even look at her after what I did.

I have anxiety OCD and anger issues. But all that was gone with her. All of it.

I wear a mask everyday to school, not because of covid, but I hate my looks.

She saw my face and and didnt cringe or look away or treat me any less.

And I ruined that.

It was so stupid of me. I tried opening up and she talked a bit and I pushed on something she said, ""I know how it feels to not be worth someone""

And I pushed and that fucked it all up.

Minutes later, I got the text. ""I think we should break up. It isn't you it's me, don't feel sad thanks for being there for me.""

I wanted to change for her. For her and no one else, I wanted to better myself specifically so she could confidently say ""I am dating him"" and everyone would be happy for her.

I'm not obese, just overweight. I've wanted to change for so long and I was gonna do it when I started dating her. Then it all came down.

I've hated myself for so god damn long and the one person who cared is gone. I don't trust anyone, except her.

My parents, hell no, my relatives? Oh fuck no with that, they would laugh in my face and talk about it like some type of joke.

That girl made me feel human. And now I'm nothing. Just some fat kid who plays video games all the fucking time and curses.

I hate life so god fucking damn much. Who the FUCK decided, ""Hey let's fucking make this poor kid over here get a girlfriend, and then watch as he fucks shit up! Funniest shit ever.""


I don't know who or what the hell is down or up, even though I'm supposed to be Christian. 

Whoever it is really just fucks with everyone with no consequences.

So a little backstory. I (19m) am a college student in a big city. My gf (19f) and I chose to go to the same school and we spend a ton of time together. Basically every second I’m not spending with school and extracurriculars, I spend with her. 

I don’t know why, but I feel like my life is so boring. I just want to do more, meet more people, hang out with friends and stuff and just live a little. I’m in college and just spend most of my days inside with my girlfriend.

I’m in multiple orgs, I work, and go to class yet I still feel incredibly lonely half the time. Yes I have my girlfriend but I struggle to make close friends that I can hang out with or talk to. Everything almost feels hopeless and it’s stupid because I have a girlfriend that is my best friend and loves me to death but it just feels like being in a relationship is also holding me back from life a bit.

so I (w25) have got a little problem on my hands.
When I finished highschool I immediately started going to university to study law. I had this picture in my mind of becoming a highpowered lawyer, making tons of money, total businesswoman, etc. 

I do like law andthe subjects we are taught but halfway through my studies my life goals changed.
 I don‘t have a deadline for the degree, but it has already taken me longer than usual (11 semesters are recommended, 12 are average, summer semester will be my 14th semester). I‘m trying my best to finish it as soon as possible, but I am depressed and lost all motivation because it doesn‘t fit my desired lifestyle anymore.

Now for my actual lifegoals:

My dream is to become a housewife (please let me elaborate before yelling at me 😂).

The way I imagine it, he would go to work, I would cook, clean, run errands, take care of other miscellaneous stuff and later on take care of our kids. I just want a husband to adore, serve him dinner with a kiss when he comes home and he doesn‘t have to lift a finger. Then we both relax together, he relaxes from work, I relax from housework. 
And it‘s not that I‘m against working (in my ideal world I would work in a makeup store a few hours per week just to get out and because it‘s my passion), I just don‘t want a career. 

I feel so horrible because I feel pressured from family and friends to be a career woman and climb the ladder and whatnot.

Sorry for the wall of text, but any advice/comment is appreciated. Is this realistic? How do I proceed? What would you guys do/ recommend? General comments/opinions?

He just has a little quirk where he tries to kill anything below the height of 3'. I had to pull him off a couple of different dogs early on in life during some violent encounters, and luckily, the victim dog owners never had us put him down. (finger in a dogs butthole gets them to unlock real quick). Over the years, we've had trainers, but to little avail. So, in order to keep him alive and free from a legally required euthanization, he gets muzzled in public and doesn't get to be around other dogs/children besides our older dog Dutchess who he is nice to, the only other creature on earth that he is nice to besides adult humans.

While this would be a sustainable life for him til he passes away naturally, we brought a beautiful baby girl into the world about 8 months ago. He has tried to attack her a couple of times, and goes absolutely balistic on our sliding glass door when he sees her. I've always been able to step in and stop any potential issue, because he listens to me from our training, but he will not listen to anyone else. Not even my wife. So now he is an outdoor dog, sleeping in our garage next to a space heater - he really hates the cold due to having short hair and we live in WA. This has been sustainable for the last 6 months because we can pop out and see him while our daughter is sleeping, or bring him inside to our guest bedroom when it's &lt;32° outside (bout 45° in the garage not infront of the space heater).

however, my time being at home for most of the week is over, and my new job requires me to work 60 hours a week. Due to his nature and aggression issues our nannies have not been willing to interact with him, meaning he is getting almost no attention when I am not home. Plus, he's not really having a good time outside because it's too cold for him to hangout. Basically with the new job, he will be huddled by a space heater for the next 3 months and only seeing me for about 15 mins a day and maybe another 15 mins from my wife who also works a full-time job, and is still breastfeeding. Dutchess hangs out inside with our daughter, because she is a great dog and helps keep her busy if we need 5 mins to do the dishes or use the bathroom.

We can't afford to send him to another expensive dog training place. He can't be rehomed due to being a dog/child aggressive dog. Then, on top of that, he has a heart murmur that causes him to have seizures, so he requires regular vet visits and a $60 per month prescription. Not really a dog people will adopt. If we surrendered him to a shelter, he would live for a couple weeks alone, then gets euthanized. Which seems like a shit way for him to go out, alone and confused.

While my daughter cannot open doors yet, that window is fast closing because she's pretty much walking independently and only needs to grow about 3 more inches to reach the locks/door handles. So even with careful oversight, she may let him in one day and he would fuck her up discovery channel style. Which the potentiality of this event would be after he spends the next 3 months not having a good life in the garage/outside.

With all of this, I see only one option - euthanizing him. But my wife doesn't/can't make the decision. She has acknowledged that it is our only option for him, but then the next day she'll back out of it. I've told her if she needs me to just do it, I can while she is at work so she doesn't have the guilt of putting him down. She has never given me a clear answer because this is the same in her book as making the decision. But River has been her dog. He kept her company while I was deployed, and really just gone for the four years I was in the Marine Corps. It seems fitting that she is there for his final moments. But if she is not willing to, and just wants to push the decision down the road for 3 months til it is a problem, then we might not be successfully proactive in keeping all parties safe. She has said the only reason she can't do it, is because she wouldn't be able to live with herself if she made the decision to put him down.

Do I put our dog down when she is at work so she doesn't have to have the guilt associated with it? but then she doesn't get a proper goodbye and the potential closure.
or
Should I push the decision down the road even further with the hopes that my wife will stomach the decision before a bad situation happens? Which we will eventually be forced to do, unless he passes away from his heart/ seizure issues like the vets said would've happened years ago, but more than likely at this rate we'll be forced to make the decision this summer after a long winter of River not having a good time. We've been in this limbo for a little over a year, since we found out she was pregnant, and IMO the safe window for both my daughter and River to live on the same property is only til about June at this rate.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28223,public,self,"Do I put our dog down now without my wife, or try to push the decision down the road with the hopes she'll be on board?

I've been struggling to write this for a while, but I've added the too long didn't read at the top for ease. This is also my first time posting, so again, sorry if there are mistakes.

TL;DR How do people get the motivation to improve their life because they are unhappy with it while ignoring the voice in their head that says they should be happy for what they have because compared to most of the world because they have it easy and their issues are just the emotional and psychological 1st world problems that make them seem entitled and privileged for not appreciating what they do have.

I'm a 26-year-old white male living in Australia with a loving partner and a beautiful 8-month-old daughter, and in 3 years, I should be financially secure and own a house with my partner and me in safe, well-paying jobs. I'm studying to be an electrician, and my partner is learning to be a skin/laser specialist, but we're barely scraping by in the meantime. I'm a just barely average partner but a good dad. I struggle to be both, and while it is entirely unfair on my partner, I know who has to be prioritized, even if I feel like a piece of shit for doing so. 

I find trying anything new downright intimidating. Everything costs money, and I never have any to spare. I weigh the right amount I should, but it's all in the wrong place, and I want to work out but can't afford it. I keep trying to read about how to exercise at home, but I struggle to do it properly, and I get in my head every time and stop. I haven't been to school in nearly eight years, and I'm struggling with my studies more than I feared I would. I have no hobbies. For the past eight years, all I've done once I'm home from work is watch tv/movies because I have barely any money for any practical or leisurely activities. Any time I do have money, it's because I've spent what little time I'd have working for the extra cash, which always goes anywhere but my savings. 

Finding out something's either not my passion, or I suck at it so much, whether it's a necessary skill or hobby that ends up being a waste of money and precious time, is terrifying. I have no idea how to move past that because if I don't pick something that will work out, it will demoralize me more than I already am. I know that if I stopped watching tv, I'd have more time, but it is all I have left in terms of enjoying myself now, so the idea of giving up on that in the pursuit of other things that I could fail at and feeling worse seems to me as though I'm robbing myself of what little joy I have.

I want to stop feeling like this to be a better partner and continue being a good father to my daughter, but I feel so much pressure that it's paralyzing me. I don't want to be that person who looks back on their life at 80, regretting every decision. I'm already beginning to look back and obsess over what I could have done differently to be in a better position which I know isn't helping, but I can't seem to stop. 

I keep hearing that my twenties is my time to find myself and explore but at the same time, hearing these are the years I shouldn't waste setting myself up for the future. This is supposed to be the prime time for getting my body into shape, and I don't want to waste it. I want to get hobbies that will allow me to make friends because I'm severely lacking in the friend and social skills area, but I don't want it to come at the cost of risking my and my family's future. I've not been able to enjoy my early twenties because I've already let these issues stop me from doing so, and with the time I now spend focused on my daughter; I don't want these issues to impact further the little time I have for me to make the most out of my twenties either. 

I've spent years trying to find a way to say this, and since I've had my daughter, it's become more complicated because I don't want it to come across as though my partner and daughter are burdens. It's just that I need (and want) to spend enough time with them, so they aren't and don't feel neglected while still having time for myself and improving as a person and just enjoying life and not going through the motions and feeling like a cog in a machine and regretting on missed experiences and time not well spent. I already feel better just writing this out and feeling like I've adequately expressed my desires because after so long, even if it is somewhat all over the place, it feels like an accomplishment just finally being able to finish writing this. I hate that this is an achievement for me. I feel like all of this is such a 1st world problem, and I'm so entitled and unappreciative of what I have that I don't deserve to feel like this when there are people all over the world that would kill to have at least one of the comforts I have, but I'm sick of feeling this way, and I don't know how to stop it. 

I feel depressed and lost and unworthy of my family, and it's affecting them, and I can't keep doing this to them. I don't think I'm necessarily dumb. Still, I am not smart enough to figure this out on my own in a way that ruins my future in some critical way, like at the cost of a relationship with my partner or how I raise my daughter and the impressions and early life lessons that will imbed in her. I am lost, and there is no easy answer, but I need help trying to figure out how to survive and make the most of my time, so I don't waste another decade of my life like I have the past two and lose the only important things I've managed to hold onto.",True,False,False,LifeAdvice,t5_2rj8a,28215,public,self,"How do people move past their insecurities of inadequacy to improve their lives, and how do they push through the failures and setbacks while trying?",0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/sfjplb/how_do_people_move_past_their_insecurities_of/,no_ads,0.0,,,,,,,,

I have multiple autoimmune diseases that make it pretty rough for me to get by sometimes. I had a crash so bad when COVID hit that I lost months of work - right after we had burned through our Emergency fund and savings for several minor disasters, including losing my job because Corona trashed our company.  I got our house payments stopped till June of 2022. I lost my insurance from losing my first job. 

I ended up getting another job though, but making less. I make $27 an hour in Central Florida. The housing market has exploded so houses are astronomically through the roof. I've though about selling this one and downgrading, but even the downgrades here are getting $100k over market. It's insanity. I'd go from a $320k house that's worth $450k right now (Zillow says $410k), to a $200k house that's probably only with $100k. I don't know what side of that particular bubble I'll end up on, because I think it's going to crash eventually.

I am a machinist. I'd say I'm a 8/10 skill level wise, and I typically end up as one of the top guys in the shop - if not the top. I have a lot of really specialized skills and I'm a quick learner. I currently am heavily relied on in my shop - after another machinist leaves in a few months, I'll be the only one who can produce massive amounts of their business. I make $27 / hour with occasional bonuses ($100-$1000 range). My wife works part time while building up her own business (we owned a very successful photography / videography studio in Illinois).

I'm currently enrolled in school for mechanical engineering, but it's going to be very expensive and hard to go back to school and earn a second degree (first is in Psych). There are a ton of scholarships I qualify for though. 

I need to either bring down expenses or drastically increase my pay. We are already running pretty lean, but the drop in income has hurt. New insurance is much more expensive. I haven't had my meds in a couple months between catching Corona myself and insurance issues. They are $12k+ a month. I \*think\* we will make it through and be able to afford our house payments after getting some of our debt we've accrued going through life issues, but damn is it rough. 

I really, truly, love my job. I want to get an engineering degree to get more income and be deeper into manufacturing. I'd love to be in a shop on the bleeding edge of something where I'd have to be deeply involved in something on the engineering side, but still get my hands dirty. I've already got some of the ""practical"" engineering skills like Solidworks, Autocad, and I know a fair bit of the day-to-day from working really closely with engineers in other machining jobs. 

Here's the rub though. I used to be a full-stack web developer at a college. I know quite a bit of the IT side, I'm fairly skilled in SQL, C#, ASP, HTML, CSS. I've built fairly complex web apps and I've done a fair amount of C# app programming, mostly winforms. I've dabbled in python. I know a bit of statistics from college the first time and I'm interested in data science, but I haven't had a real 'data science' job. I didn't enjoy some of the things about the work-life balance, and I ended up quitting to freelance and then got into machining. I'd say I was a pretty average programmer, with the exception of I was pretty damn good with maintaining a very large website and developing pretty involved versions of CRUDs - Like a form that would take demographics data from the student admissions system (I also did that one) and would generate follow up questions based on the results and match them with scholarships.

I'm not sure I want to get back into the web side or programming in general. I haven't had much programming experience outside academia, but I'm guessing the salary is much larger. I'd probably still want to eventually end up in engineering if the stars and planets align. 

Would you stay in a job you love with so much financial burden or try to break back into an industry that you've already left? Is trying for a second bachelors a good idea?  Should I sell my house and find cheaper living? Anyone hiring in Central Florida or remote a programmer that needs to have a deep machining or manufacturing background? 

\-----

Random aside - if my life sounds like a shit show: In the last three years my whole family has had corona, I've had it twice. One of my best friends, my grandma and one of my mentors died. I moved 1000 miles from home. I've had a multi-month Lupus flare, which I am still in. I've been accepted to three colleges and am taking classes at all three, just because that's the way the prerequisites for Mechanical Engineering worked out around my full-time job. I had two of my dogs die within 24 hours of each other. My roof collapsed at my old house. My septic system backed up into my house - twice - at the new one and had to be completely replaced. My wife had a major bipolar episode that resulted in being hospitalized and almost wrecked our marriage. I lost a cushy machining job because of covid. I got a new job the same day I got fired making 80k/year running their night shift, but then lost it because I couldn't physically go to work due to illness. I've been in the hospital twice with kidney stones in the last year. I spent three days admitted for a panic attack that was so bad that my blood pressure skyrocketed so high that it was unreadable on our cuffs, and they had difficulty with it in the ambulance. I started a ridiculous number of drugs trying to get the Lupus livable enough to support my family, two of which I had major reactions too. I've developed extreme depression and anxiety that comes along with my Lupus flares. I'm anemic and am having difficulty absorbing nutrients so I'm tired as hell. I've went from having an emergency fund and money in the bank to getting my power shut off-thrice. 

It is what it is.

I think I should go over everything important first.  
I was born in Japan and lived there 14 years. My parents were in the military, and are African American. I grew up as a foreigner there for a long time and it didn't help my mental at all, however, a lot of my friends that I ended up making there through it all told me that I shouldn't try to bother people too much about it all. I got really depressed later on when I got into highschool and had to move away from the only friends that I had ever made, because my mom got divorced with my father. My mom has been with two new men, one cheated on her, and the other is an asshole who hates me but loves her. I dont care that he hates me, but, at one point, the mix of depression and anger caused me a lot of rebellion, and I started messing up in highschool. I got bad grades, and then in my senior year, I skipped over 30 days, and had to repeat the senior year. I still graduated, but with pretty poor grades. I haven't looked into college because I have no money, and i've been working minimum wage jobs to pass by life, but, I recently had another mental breakdown and I ended up spending a ton of my money on a bunch of BS just to make myself happy.   


I dont blame my parents, or any of the circumstances, and even if they are to blame, I really dont care. I want to get things going. I want to start my life but im completely lost. I have a literal $0 to my name, and I am getting a new work from home job this coming February. I want to leave my parents, however, they have decided that I only have around 5 months to do so. What do I do?

I just assume that it's kind of similar for most human beings. At least I know that it is the case for me.

Living kind of a hippie life if you would want to put it that way.

I’ve never posted on one of these before so hopefully I get a response 

So I’m a sophomore in highschool and I had been best friends with this girl since 6th grade. And like BEST friends the type that you tell everything to, and change in front of each other, and admit to everything you’ve done.. like a deep friendship. 

We had a very bitter end to our “unbreakable” bond because she ghosted me and stopped caring enough to hang out or be close… she was more focused on getting “mature” friends and get “popular” you could say. 

Anyways this absolutely broke me as she was my only friend and we were so close.. the whole experience made it super hard for me to get new friends because she always made me feel like I wasn’t worth it.

Now we get to the present and my problem: 

Me and her had a lot of mutual friends: a lot of which she met through me and were always closer to me. We’ve not been friends for about a year now and I noticed all of those friends drifted closer to her, and are barely close with me anymore, even after I told them what she did and how bad it affected me.. it honestly hurts really bad. 

I still love these friends because I’ve known them for so long and they’ve done so much for me, but I just can’t stand to see them having so much fun with my ex BFF while I’ve had to go through this whole thing basically alone. 

Idk if I’m just being selfish in not wanting them to interact because we were all friends at one point, but I feel like they barely contact me anymore and it’s clear they’re not as close as they used to be, and I can’t help but think that it’s because of her. Am I wrong for this? What can I do if anything?

Secondly, I want to go to college for agriculture, but I don't know if I should use the G.I bill to basically get in for free. Unfortunately, I don't understand how the G.I. bill works. Could someone please explain it to me?

I guess I’m feeling lost and would like some insight into possible next steps.

Im a male in my mid 20s living in Los Angeles. I graduated with a degree in creative writing. I’m currently working as a handyman for a rental property company. 

I grew up in a very tense and emotionally distant family. I was mostly raised by my immigrant grandparents while my mother often worked 16+ hours at her business. I feel like I checked out of my family situation by mentally dissociating and physically distancing myself in my bedroom. 

I didn’t learn much about my Hispanic culture, or even how to socialize well with the kids around me. I feel like I was raised by tv, video games, and the internet. I’m sure many can relate. Now I’m on my own with my girlfriend and life is feeling more and more overwhelming. 

I’ve had jobs before but I’ve quit them. Usually because I can’t stand the social anxiety of feeling like an awkward gullible guy. Im my head, my managers or coworkers dislike me or are suspicious of me. I feel constantly judged. All my neurosis makes me appear as an aloof or even angry person. 

I want to point my life towards helping others such as therapy or mental health counseling, but I struggle to even keep myself afloat. I am sure I have heaps of undiagnosed mental health issues myself.

I got a job working for the government as a Policy Analyst, and I’m so miserable. I hate working 9-5. It feels like I’m in a jail, trapped to my chair looking at a computer screen 8 hours a day. I work from home, and I can’t imagine how people function working 9-5 from an office. 

Since I’ve started working here I’ve never felt more exhausted, depressed, and anxious. I can’t sleep, I’ve developed an eating disorder, my acne and eczema are flaring up, I get panic attacks, and I have zero energy after work to do anything social. I’ve been actively applying to new jobs but I feel like I’ll end up feeling the same way, since they’re all 9-5. The content of my job isn’t that great though, which is why I’m trying to switch regardless. But I don’t know how much longer I can last. I wake up a couple hours before work to go for a walk. I walk on my lunch. I lift weights after work. I meal prep on Sundays so that my evenings aren’t spent cooking and cleaning. I don’t drink caffeine, alcohol, or eat unhealthy. I even tried to pursue personal training after work but the lockdowns ruined that. In other words, I’m doing all the things you’re supposed to do in order to make a 9-5 more manageable, and I still can’t stand it. 

When I was in school, the studying never stopped, I worked two jobs, went to the gym, lived on my own, and still somehow felt less exhausted. Because I was in control of my own schedule, and my day was broken up with multiple different things. I wasn’t in a jail. I got summers off, and even though I worked during those summers, I could at least go on a vacation and not have to get permission from a boss. 

I’ve been here at this job for 6 months. Even if I got a job making more money at a better company, I’d have no time or energy to spend that money. And my brain is so fried from the computer screen.

&amp;#x200B;

21M gay guy here. I've never had sex, never kissed, never flirted (and no one ever flirted with me), never been in a relationship (some online relationships, but come on). And this is poisoning me. I can't go out and see young couples (gay or straight) because I envy them. I can't be near beautiful people either. I want to torture them to make them feel all my pain. Why they have everything I want with no effort? I feel awful (physically) whenever anyone talks about sex near me. It's even worse when I remember that everyone had their first experiences in their 15's or some shit. And gay ppl tend to have it even younger. And, to be clear, I \_always\_ knew I was gay, I always had crushes in guys, so I can't even use the ""intenalized homophobia as a young gay"" to justify my shitty sexual/romantic life. And I feel like I'm getting old, that soon my life will be over and my body will be gross. And it seems like that no matter how much skincare I do, how much weight I lose, how much I style my hair, how much I try to wear nice clothes, how much I try to be nice, polite and lovely with guys... no one wants me. What do they want me to do? Peel my face off and get a new one? Am I even that ugly??? I don't think I'm ugly. I just hate it that other people apparently think I'm ulgy.

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the reason I'm in that situation is my family's fault. They always repressed my sexuality and every attempt I did to be more feminine (once my mom saw me shaving my legs, she freaked out). They never gave me too much freedom to go out and sleep out of my house, and it has gotten worse with covid. I downloaded tinder and grindr, and I only got an extremely awkward date with an old guy. Also, my parents are always telling me I should get a girlfriend, because I'm always in a bad mood. God knows how much I hate them for mocking me like that.

&amp;#x200B;

The other reason, besides looks and lack of freedom, is that I'm very shy. I don't think I ever told a guy ""I like you"" or at least ""I think you're hot"" irl. I mean, I can pretty much be punched in the face if I say that to a homophobic guy, and I never had a crush who I was 100% sure was gay. Even if I had, I don't know if being rejected by a guy I like is something I could handle well. I don't have many friends. I don't go to parties (because I'm not gonna pay to be ignored all night while I see other people making out). And I guess people think I'm weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can be lovely, I can be caring, I can be funny, I can be attentive, I can be flexible, I can be understanding, I can be affectionate... but no one gives me an opportunity to show that side of myself. What could I possibly do to end this hell?

First of all I have literally no personal hygiene. I never wash my face. I have multiple teeth decays and my gum is receding because I never brush my teeth. I only shower 2 times a week. And when I shower it lasts almost 3 goddamn hours because I am the laziest fuck ever and spend most of my time in the shower sitting and thinking. I never care for my clothes either. And the worst part is I was proud of my lack of concern for my hygiene and appearance until a year ago because I associated these things with trying to be appealing to the opposite sex. I know, I was a huge moron. But I still don't do any of these things. Now I know the importance of being presentable, but I lack the energy. Besides I feel like I will still be disgusting no matter what I do.

My social skills are even worse. I can't look at people in the eye (especially the opposite sex). I am scared of social interactions. I hate people's company I prefer to be alone. I don't have any friends. I can't keep a conversation, because apparently I forgot how normal people communicate as a result of not talking to people for years and fear of saying something awkward stresses me out a lot. At first I thought my inability to socialize was not a problem since I hated it anyway,but it is a problem. I will have to socialize with people when I have a job to be successful.

I can't do chores either. I can't cook. I can't clean. I don't make my bed. My mom and dad attempted to teach me these things but I refused to learn, since I wasn't interested in doing any of them. They were too boring and tiring for me.

Surprisingly my grades are very high and I want to study medicine. I have been studying hard for college exams from the beginning of this year but for like three weeks I can't study anymore. I sit in front of my desk all day, but nothing gets done, because I am daydreaming all the time and I can't focus. I think I am tired and bored of studying but I should really study. If this continues I can't get into the college I want.

Academic success was my only good quality and now I'm losing it too. I am miserable. I am an adult but I am pretty sure kids half my age have more life skills than me.

What I really wanted here is an honest,impartial opinion on something that's like a decision I have to take,and precisely from completely unknown people because maybe it's hard for family or friends to get this,so here goes.

 I'm a trained classical dancer and singer, it's been 10 years since I started . The thing here is I don't have a left arm from down the elbow,and that's by birth. Not sure why this happened,but there's nothing that can be done except artificial limbs and I've tried that(didn't really workout for me). So I'm like pretty cool as I am,can get majority stuff done by myself and am living a happy normal life. .

But now it's time to choose careers.I've always loved dancing and music equally,all my life. I would probably give anything to do something in either of these fields,just be an artist. But there's one established fact with dance that no matter how good I dance there's the one thing that's always going to attract unwanted attention. And I know you want to sympathize with me,you feel sorry but please atleast acknowledge the art I'm performing. I believe and it might not be true in all the scenarios,but most appreciation that I get is not because they thought I genuinely danced well but maybe because people felt sorry for a handicapped person dancing or just inspired, maybe. I just feel I would never be able to break through that first gaze that fixes up at one place while I'm dancing,making them completely unaware of all the stuff that I actually performed on stage.So that got crossed off the list.

Then came music,you just need to sit and sing,and that's about it! I have sung a few covers with some established singers,and also received high appreciation from some really accomplished people in this field. I promise to work hard and strive to make it big here purely on the skill that I have,but then again there's always this thing that will people still accept a singer or popular figure normally like they do,for someone that's different from how they've normally seen people? I do shows and people hear me sing and even when they haven't seen me ,they appreciate what they heard,but is this judgement going to get clouded when I perform physically in front of them?even when it's normally sitting and singing.I want to make it big in this industry, perform for people,just do what I do best but,

Would I ever be like those artists that people follow,go to concerts of,or just like listening to?

Help me out with anything that crossed your mind after reading this. This has been bugging me a lot,so please be as brutally honest and upfront as you can, would really help someone out here. Thanks:-)

To make a long story short, a patient fell and suffered a head injury after I left them unattended in a piece of moving equipment. I was cleaning the patient and left the bay for a split second to grab a fresh bed sheet. While I was gone, the patient fell backwards and hit his head off the ground. 

Falls happen often in hospital. But this fall was severe. The sound of the fall was horrendous. The other healthcare assistant (who was in the bay at the time) began pointing at me and shouting “how did you manage that?” Probably because she wanted to deflect the blame from her and onto me. 

The patient was unresponsive and would not open his eyes. Even the nurses seemed shocked and didn’t know what to do. They had to press the emergency CPR button in order to summon the doctors. People kept shouting things like “get a blood pressure machine” “does he a have resuscitation order?” I began bracing myself for someone to announce that the patient was dead.

A nurse eventually came up to me and said “it’s okay, it’s not your fault.” And that was when I finally felt some relief. 

After the incident, the patient was sent for a CT head scan. The next day, the curtains were drawn around his bed and his wife was visiting. Visitors are banned due to Covid unless the patient is nearing the end of their life. That’s when I knew it was bad.

The patient suffered a fracture to his skull which resulted in bleeding in his brain. Surgery was too high risk due to how poorly and frail the he was. He died 3 days after the accident. 

The ward manager called me into her office and said “it’s not your fault, the doctor has been expecting him to die for weeks. you are a student and you shouldn’t have been left to care for the patient independently.” Since the accident, my co-workers have mentioned that I have been less talkative and that I seem sad. I know they’re trying to support me and, to be honest, I’m lucky that they haven’t turned against me. But I just don’t have the energy to speak to them.  

I no longer have any motivation or enthusiasm when I turn up to work. I don’t like facing my colleagues. I have to force myself to go into work.

I'm 34. No kids. Never married. I'm originally from the midwest, but I moved to the southwest about 6 months ago. Basically just made a crazy decision to pack up and move somewhere where I knew nobody. Bought a house online. Lots of crazy decision making. 

I was hoping a fresh start would make me happier. Instead I ended up with a fixer upper house that is really driving me crazy. I'm definitely depressed. My favorite part of my day is going to bed and I dread getting out of bed in the morning. I struggle with maintaining a healthy lifestyle too. I've drank too much for years, but have recently got a bit better about that. I was bored a year ago and wanted a major change. Basically I traded boredom with mild depression for anxiety with major depression. There's not much for me back home but I find myself wanting to give up and go home.

I worry that all this stress I feel will lead to some sort of a spiral. I have a good paying job (that I don't like). But I could see the stress bleeding over into work. Me losing my job. My house. Etc.

I don't know. This sucks. I'm in my mid thirties and feel like I've really accomplished nothing. I'm not sure I have much ambition either. Relationships are hard work. Kids seem impossible. Yet im ashamed I feel that way.

I am absolutely shaking right now. I have never felt this much fear in my life.

I really do not want to end it all. I would hate to do this to my loved ones who have put so much time and energy into me. 

However, I am now being put into a situation that is causing me to have extreme panic attacks and uncontrollable thoughts. I am starting a full time job and have autism, anxiety, depression. This scares me immensely, but my parents think it is what is best for me. I wasted most of my Teenage years and now the start of my twenties because of severe panic and phobia of social interaction. 

My parents say the job will be good for me but, I am so so scared.  I have never had a job before and jumping into a full time position feels like a death sentence. I basically have to take the job thought because it upsets my parents to see me this way and, I really can't blame them. I am this close to walking to the nearest hospital and checking myself in but, I can't even imagine the cost of that. I do have insurance but it would still be a large amount of money. Has anyone else been in this situation? The worst they could do is fire me right? 

The thought of bringing in a lawn mower into my room and letting the carbon monoxide kill me keeps crossing my mind. I have determined it to be the least messy way to go about it. I don't want to think about this but it is what my mind keeps going back to and I am scared. I have talked to the suicide hot line, I told them I wasn't on the verge of killing myself but the thought has been increasing in my mind. Would someone please tell me it is going to be okay? I have to take this job or I don't know what it will do to parents to see me lose yet another opportunity in my life to my mental problems.

Some background? I (19) got my certificate for vet assisting back in September but unfortunately am not In the financial situation to move to anywhere that has a vet clinic (we have one here where I interned but they treated me and their clients extremely poorly). My job also cut my hours so I had to apply somewhere else. 

I recently started a waitressing job, my first time ever serving. I will say I've only had four shifts, a total of 22 hours. 

There are parts I absolutely love, I love the actual serving part. I like making people happy. My bosses are really kind and patient. My co-workers aren't terrible either (half of them don't speak much English so we don't chat very much, but they're always happy to see me and I am happy to see them too). They're all really keen on helping me. The food is also superb. 

But I don't like the pressure and I'm really nervous for the spring and summer time when we get more business. I also have really bad anxiety around my health and I am terrified to be around so many people with the new wave. 

The pet store in town is hiring, and I think it would be really nice to use at least some of my knowledge from school instead of letting it go to waste before I'm able to work in a clinic or rescue setting. 

I'm feeling really torn, my best friend says I should give it more time since I haven't been there that long (but I also think it's because she's dating head of staff). My gut is also telling me it just isn't right for me. Food service isn't for everyone.

Lately I've just been greatly struggling with myself. I have days where I am feeling pretty down on myself and depressed at times and I do not know why. Things are not bad per say currently I help manage a hotel (which is a hour from current main home and the city) the hotel is owned by my foreign parents, they are pretty loving and I usually spend 2-3 days out of the week at the hotel assisting my parents while my parents are there all week(they also live on the property). The hotel has been a little difficult for my parents to manage because of the language barrier and technology barrier now since they are older but all in all they still manage, but me being there definitely makes things a lot easier for them. Managing hotels has always been the family business and something they have done for 30 years, while I love being able to help my parents and be there for them, I myself hate managing a hotel but I know my parents need my help for the time being. My parents also pay me decent for my time. Outside of the hotel I do photography which I do in the city, I am currently on a hiatus trying to rebrand my photography business but I have been struggling to find the motivation for it, many days I feel depressed and low and I do not get any work done. I get all in my head. I really want to advance in my career and find a path but I don't know how at times. I feel stuck.

Im also in a loving relationship and she is doing wonderful in her career something I would never say to her because I always support her and want the best for her but I do internally feel jealous at times at the amount of money she is making because its a good bit more than me and how she has a clear pathway for her but besides that I love her very much. I guess I just want to be on a good path like her, I get scared sometimes she will think I am a bum and leave me. I also struggle with also achieving my personal goals like working out, reading more etc.

Many days I have had thoughts of killing myself which sucks because I know I'm in a good position in life and I am still very young. I know my life isn't bad and there a lot of things to feel positive about but everyday when I wake up i think i want to do better. I want to do better in my career and get back to doing photography consistently and not struggling to work, I want to be a better boyfriend and son, I want to do better for myself. I struggle with staying focused and disciplined. So many days i feel lost and I do not know where i am going. I also find myself in the cycle of comparing to others.

I'm in therapy and take medication but none of it is helping and I think a large aspect of my problems is that my world view is very pessimistic. 

Overall I love life. I love the experiences and so much of what it has to offer. Those things are what have kept me alive so far. 
But there are also a lot of things I despise about life itself. From the fact you need money to survive, to how much of life is trial and error in order to figure out what makes you content, and gives you meaning, to small things such as having to work towards certain things when I just want to be able to experience it. 
So many of the things I hate are unable to change. They are intrinsic to our world and how it works. And I realize that. I know I can't change the things I hate. I know that it's impossible for the world to even exist in the ways I desperately want it to. 
I know I end up just sounding spoiled and with my foot not in reality. But there's such a big part of me that feels I will never be happy to the point I wish to be because of this world view. 
I don't know how to change it, or how to move forward with it. 

I've desperately tried my hardest to focus on the parts of life I enjoy, and to live in the moment. But there continues to be this clawing part of my brain that feels so absolutely overwhelmed and 'depressed' about the things I'll never be able to change about the world I live in. 
And regardless of if I'm in a depressive state or not, this world view stays the same. 
I just feel stuck in a world I'll never be happy with. And all I can do is accept that and just enjoy what I can. 
But that's becoming so damn difficult to do. 

I feel like I'm left without a drive to live. 
I don't know what I want to achieve with my existence to make it feel worth it.

I have been looking to move somewhere new and get my own place while I try and save but I can’t trust myself to be disciplined. My family have offered to let me move back home but we don’t have much space and I would have to share a room with my mom. I feel like everything sucks and I’m stuck in a loop where circumstances just keep getting out of hand.

I really appreciate you reading this, first off. I turned 31 recently and am really feeling the pressure of having a career figured out. I have been working since I was 14 in a variety of industries and I have never been able to settle on anything I’ve wanted to do long term. I have worked primarily in restaurants. I’ve worked cooking, waiting tables, barbacking/bartending and for a local pizza place making pizzas and delivery driving. I’ve gone to community college, worked in the supply chain world doing warehouse work and even doing accounting/low level IT work. I got my real estate license a few years back and have done a couple deals and completed barber college as well. Currently I am working at barber shop 5 days per week and working at the local pizzeria delivering on the weekends. The thing is that I really don’t like  barbering at all and I’ve been trying to make it work but to absolutely no avail.

I’m lucky to live and work delivering in a nice area and I make really great money. I’ve always been into saving/investing so money isn’t really a problem to me. I am getting married in a few months and my fiancé and I are buying our house from a family member for an extreme discount. 

Growing up I had parents (dad) that was one of those union workers who thinks that anything less than slaving away for 50+ hours per week for 40+ years to retire with a pension down in Florida isn’t a real job. He wasn’t thrilled with me doing the barber school and he sure as hell thinks I’m a loser working at a pizza place. I don’t really care what he thinks but I’m just terrified to tell anyone that “hey I’m reinventing myself again!” Cause I feel like that’s what most of my adult life has been. I’ve considered going back to school for education because I think it’s something I’d really be good at and I’d love making a difference in young peoples lives. I’ve also considered just delivering for now and maybe just being a guy who does a bunch of different things like I do now.

I guess I’m coming here for some validation. Is there anything wrong with any of this? If I go for the teaching thing, am I too old?

Just after some advice and not sure where to turn. 
I (F27) have just returned back from work after maternity leave and I have a persistent itch to get out of my city. The population growth here is rapidly increasing, the traffic is a nightmare and house prices have skyrocketed in some situations up to $100AUD+ per week for rentals. I’m a fresh social worker who hasn’t had any social work experience outside of my current job (including both student placements) and I want to grow, expand and develop to eventually be considered for senior positions. 

Only problem is, my partner (M, 26) would be depressed moving somewhere further and doesn’t seem open to the idea at all. He loves his friends and his family and we see them all the time. I’m not from here so I have nothing but my partner and baby tying me to here. 

It’s also become evident the “breadwinning” will be on me, because although my partner works extremely hard, he has had the same job since he was 18 and has barely had a pay rise since. I just want to give a good life to our baby, and even just getting out for a year or two so we can save for a house deposit would be amazing. Rural social work jobs pay exceptionally well, on top of employee benefits such as subsidised rent and tax savings.  to see what people say nonetheless.

I guess ive been living life.
I dropped out of Uc Berkeley as a 3rd yr and started working for my parents at their sushi restaurant. My goal is try and grow some investments(crypto and stocks) early on and even though it might not be more than what school can offer id rather be using my body than sitting in a chair.
Its been 2 yrs since and I’ve been grinding 6 days a week all day. Currently i work 7 days 10am-11pm and its been like that for months since multiple areas of the restaurant are short staffed. My day to day tasks revolves over making sushi as a chef and serving as a waiter. As a manager ive taken over all the server-side and dishwasher side for management and I am responsible for also inventory for everything in the restaurant(so sales inflow/outflow of products)

Whenever i can I’m up at 7am and i get some personal reading and lift before work. My days are pretty much geared towards being the most efficient person that i can be and I try to own my situation to the best of my ability, and theres been a good amount of crisis’ in 2 years.

Lately Ive been feeling kinda lonely, empty, and even frustration from fatigue. Its kinda embarrassing for me to say this but 7 days a week, just working and keeping emotions to myself just has been getting to me. Ive been easily angered by customers and staff but i do keep it in and try my best to be a brotherly figure to all those working for our restaurant. I also live in a rural area, away from people i find interesting but this emptiness feels stronger whenever i think about it.

In high school I had a friend (F) who I fell in love with. I told her and she reciprocated (we cuddled) , but was unsure for a relationship because she had been hurt before and I basically pushed her to make a choice. She decided on no. This was the beginning of a back and forth of me leaving and coming back trying to be friends again, and then falling for her again and trying to get her again, etc etc. One time I basically treated her like shit and said things I shouldn’t have because I was deeply hurt and confused (during all this time, she would say things that would make me question the relationship between us again) I thought she may have decided she did wanted to be with me. So when I once again found out it was a no I flipped out and was very hurtful and said things I regret massively. It’s been a few years since then and we are still friends after a long break but now she has walls built up, doesn’t tell me much, is out there dating and messing around with other people. She cares for me and I know that, but I have a deep pain in my heart knowing that if I played this cool from the start I could have been with her. She also contributed to this toxic mess by flirting when she knew she wasn’t gonna follow through but I know in my soul that generally speaking it’s my fault. I really still do want to be with her but I know it can’t be because of my actions. Out of all the girls I’ve been with I’m most comfortable with her.

My ex and I really get along. We had a relationship of 4 years and the reason we broke up was because we wanted two oposites.
She wants a home, kids and a stable job. 
I want to travel the world in a van, a dog, and live from day to day. We are polar opposites when it comes to ambition and the things we want in life.
After a year of not talking, we started being friends again and we're very casual, no hard feelings. But everytime we fall in love again. 
We tried again as friends with benefits untill one of us met another. She's with someone now and I respect that. I don't cry about it and it doesn't stop me from being happy.
We still get along but, every time she visits, we start flirting and flirting turns into this weird game of me trying to kiss her ( knowing she'd never let me ) and her playfully not letting me ( I know deep down she wants it, she even admitted this ).
We talked about it and we're both stuck with the feeling that we're made for each other since even though our ambitions differ, our personalities clicks like no other and even after years we're still madly in love. I know she's the love of my life, but I also know that if we would try, we would ultimately fail and one of us would have to sacrifice their life's purpose, their dreams and ambitions. So we're stuck in this ''flirty friends who long for each other but don't want to have a relationship''

I've never really done this before but I'm so conflicted and have been for so long I would just like some answers. Just to be clear I am certain of my sexual orientation (Hetro), this question is more about sexuality itself.

I come from a religious background (though I no longer practise), and I was also homeschooled with online learning from the age of 12 onwards, I mention these factors as I feel they likely bear some relevance in my problem.

I am and always have been ashamed of my sexuality, that is to say I have a very high drive and had fantasies from quite a young age (10), though I never had anyone to talk to this about due to other factors (such as high functioning aspergers) I never really understood or got on well with my peers as a child/teenager and never recieved any form of Sex Education.

When I asked my parents about masturbation there answers were quite vague and unhelpful and being caught on two occasions led me to strongly associate it with shame. I also began to watch porn at around this age (very young I know) and when my sister found my diary where I had written about it she told me I wasn't the person she thought I was and that was one of the most hurtful things I have ever heard.

My relationship with porn became problematic (or at least I read about No Fap and began to percieve my habbit had become an addiction, though whether this was reality or psychosematic I couldn't tell you), and so when I started my current relationship I determined to give it, and masturbation up for good.

That obviously didn't stick (our sex life is not particuarly active or reliable) and every time I masturbated or watched porn my girlfriend was very hurt and felt it was cheating which further added to my guilt and shame.

With all that background out of the way I would like answers to the following questions, if in your combined wisdom you have any.

Is it a sin, or morally wrong, or socially unacceptable to masturbate?

Is it a sin, or morally wrong, or socially unacceptable to have sexual fantasies?

Is it cheating to have sexual experiences solo when you are in a relationship?

Is it a sin, or morally wrong, or socially unacceptable to enjoy pornography and does it make you a bad person or a sexist or a misogynist?

And finally...

Do you have any advice on how to grow more comfortable embracing and exploring your sexuality without shame or guilt?

He kept saying he know law and he is gonna be in real trouble. We waited there almost for an hour. I talked with each one. The one guy who called the police and first fought with me.

I hugged him and told him that we are here for each other and we don't want to hurt each other. After that he became calm, I called them cabs. He told us that his finger hurt and he couldn't move it. We told him several times we can go to the hospital coz we were close and he said he is gonna go tomorrow. I wrote him the other day and asked if he went. He said no and that he slept a long time and didn't feel good. I wrote him again today and he didn't respond. He went rogue. Nobody know nothing about him. I feel extremely bad for what happened, but also his behaviour weird. He was always kinda simp ( in a sense that he put girls he didn't know before us) and narrow minded, black and white guy( like you shouldn't hate on your parents because the want the best for you). But I don't know I just feel betrayed. Btw he pressed charges against one of our friends because when the guy gets drunk he talks smack about other people's moms and it's just you say something and he responds your mom bla bla it is annoying and he acts like fucking retard when he is drunk but I wouldn't press charges against him for god's sake.

It would mean more than you know to read it all and give me any support at all. 

I’m 20 years old lying in bed and tomorrow I start my first semester at a major university. I started at community college and took 2.5 years. I made it to a big school and I just don’t want to continue anymore. It feels like I’ve been depressed ever since I started college. I don’t know where this education is going to take me. What I do know is that this piece of paper I’ll get in another 2 years is gonna help me so much more to get a job in the real world. Yeah this is gonna sound cliché but fuck the real world. It’s just a trap where we feed the rich people and do their dirty work while we waste the majority of our lives makin paper for some rich fuck who doesn’t give a shit about me. I think this has been the base of my depression. I know this is the harsh reality and I can’t escape it, it’s weighing me down. I’m getting sick and tired of it. I just don’t know where I fit in. I have a great family and an amazing group of friends who are there for me no matter what. But, sometimes I feel like the only people I can really lay it all down for are strangers on the internet. There’s no judgment here. I worked in a restaurant for my time at community college and when I moved up to waiter it turned my anxiety up to 100000. I have anxiety about fucking everything now. I have always hated school and I dragged through community college feeling like I HAVE to earn my degree or else I am screwed. For the last year or so I’ve had persistent sick thoughts about those closest to me dying and the inevitability of those things kill me. I’m not ready for them. I’m not ready to leave home. I don’t want to leave my parents behind. The thing is, if I don’t finish school I’ll be stuck doing some bullshit manual labor job which Id hate even more. I don’t know what genuinely brings me happiness. The show One Piece does lmao. But that’s not true happiness. I’m not fulfilled once I realize that’s a fictional universe. My mom says my nerves are just making me want to give up before I start. And I know that’s in part right, but life just has me feeling trapped and I don’t know how to break the cycle. Im gonna wind up in a fucking office with people I hate doing something I probably don’t like. If I live off the grid it’s hard manual work keeping myself alive, then Im away from my parents and friends which terrifies me. I know Im gonna have to apply all that hard work at some point. It just fucking scares me. Hopefully this semester at a big school will help me grow. Im really hoping something pivotal happens in a good way. I want to fall in love but my one and only past relationships left me with trust issues. While I know life is the greatest gift ever, it doesn’t seem like it. I am not suicidal but I don’t even want to be here anymore. I wouldn’t kill myself because I can’t put my mom, or my family and friends, through that. I don’t want kids because bringing them into this shit world would be doing them a disservice. They shouldn’t have to feel the way I do. I know this has been all over the place. I’m struggling to figure out exactly what I want to say. I want to keep typing but, I just don’t know what else to right. If you made it this far thank you so much. I need people out there to just read my thoughts and tell me something, anything about what I’m feeling and what can help. I have unhealthy habits that need changing. It’s definitely contributing to my depression. It’s hard to change those habits. I think it’s all gonna start with my diet. I can’t cook, I’m too lazy or depressed to actually put effort into feeding myself well. I just think, what’s the point? I’m stuck in a perpetual cycle of shitty mood and eternal dread. I’m fucking sick of it. 

I want to tell you all something that I want. But I don’t fucking know what I want. I want peace and happiness! I want to be free!!!!! But this life DOESNT ALLOW FREEDOM unless you have a billion dollars. What the fuck can I do to make a difference? Help someone else when I can’t even help myself? IM SICK OF FEELING LIKE THIS. IVE COME SO FAR BUT CANT FIND MOTIVATION TO KEEP GOING. IVE ALREADY OVERCOME SO MUCH. IM STRONG. But man, is this taking a toll on me. ^ This paragraph just about sums me up lol. I don’t have the courage to say this to even my mom, who means more than anything to me. I won’t even say it to my best friends I met in highschool who saved me. My connection with them will run my entire life. But there’s some things I just still feel too vulnerable about. All my friends have set paths ahead of them. Im just trudging along trying to figure it out. Im not confident in where I’ll end up. I just gotta trust the process I guess. But that thought terrifies me. 

Ironically enough, I have ADHD that really impacts me and I just remembered to mention it, LMAO. The medication doesn’t help. The side effects fucked me. I don’t want to take that shit.

Not sure if this is the right place to go for advice or if there is more suitable thread but here goes. My parents have been together since they were about 17 and they are now in their 50's. My dad has worked his whole life as a porter/doorman and my mom became a police officer and she is retiring next year. I have 2 sisters and one brother that's now 10 years old from my parents. My parents never involved us in how they split bills but I always assumed that my dad covers the bills like internet, cable, etc. and they split the rent of the house (I'm purely guessing). As a kid when we all used to go out I remember my mom paying for most things. And growing up I think my mom has been the provider. That's how I've seen it. My dad isn't a bad dad, he's always been here for me and my siblings and he's really protective of my baby brother. He has his moments sometimes where he just seems immature and like a kid when we argue sometimes. I know he has smacked my sister one time about two years ago and immediately apologized. Other than that he has never hit us, not as kids either. I consider him my best friend cause I go to him for advice on everything. I'm 27. One of my sisters is 24 and she still lives off my parents. Mostly my dad. Anything she wants , food, books, misc shopping, she uses my dads card. He's also a family man, doesn't go out much, just really focused on his kids and my mom.

My mom is retiring next year and she wants to move to Florida, I know that she is going to put the down payment on the house cause my dad has never saved money.

I will try to be as brief and efficient with information as I possibly can. 

I always did well in school, I graduated early, took AP and college level courses in highschool and got good SAT scores with a good GPA. 

My family is/was abusive and I did a lot of dumb shit out of necessity, which wrecked my credit. 

At this point I have no savings, no car, no college degree, awful credit (~400), and borderline severe mental health issues. 

I have good and varied work experience, and currently work as a Fraud Analyst. I make enough to support my family but that’s it. It’s paycheck to paycheck with nothing left for savings. 

My husband is financially abusing me (refuses to work). I tried divorcing him but it fucked up my daughter to have us separated, and he lied and told me he was working (was not working) so I said ok let’s try again and go to therapy, etc. Things were going well prior to me finding out he lied and did not have a job. 

I would love to go back to school. 

A few years ago I decided I would work towards nursing school as it is a relatively short program for pretty decent pay (travel nurses can make upwards of $100k, which compared to $30k is good for me). 

Well I fucked up so bad in school between my mental illness, drug addiction (clean and sober for years now), homelessness, etc. I have tried to go to college so many times, and all of the schools around me I owe money to. 

There is one CC where I only owe about $700 so I could possibly pay that off, but I would have to pay 2 semesters out of pocket before I would qualify for loans/grants again. Which isn’t feasible for me since I live paycheck to paycheck. 

I’m doing EMDR 2x/week to deal with my trauma and it’s really helping. 

I’m just stuck. I need money to fix my credit, to save, to go to school, to buy a car, etc and I just don’t have it.  In my area I have a job that pays higher than most unskilled positions without a college degree. I can’t really get a second job because I rely on people for rides and cannot find child care (yes, really). 

I considered filing for bankruptcy to start working on my credit but that’s $1,400 which I obviously don’t have. 

I could work at the hospital near me like in the cafeteria and they would pay for college. However, I would take a huge pay cut and they work on reimbursement so I would have to come up with the funds first. 

I don’t party or do drugs, I don’t pay for internet (I rent hotspots from the library for free), I only eat one meal a day so my grocery bill is mostly just feeding my daughter. I don’t pay for a cell phone (just use internet on my old iPhone I paid of years ago). My apartment is 700 square feet. I use family’s streaming accounts to watch TV so I don’t pay for those. 

I just don’t even have anywhere to cut things out to save money, second job isn’t an option, getting a better paying job isn’t an option. 

What the fuck do I do? 



My dream has always been to be a farmer. I have worked on farms, did 4-H and originally went to school for agriculture (before dropping out). But I need land, equipment, etc. I am a woman so would qualify for some really nice USDA loans to start a farm BUT my credit is so shitty they won’t approve me until I get it up to a 620. 

I hate my job, I hate my relationship. I feel so stuck. It’s all I ever think about…trying to get out of this and work towards a better future.

I'm in a rather dire situation, I'm depressed, socially-anxious and effectively unemployable. I've been trying to move out, seek help, acquire therapy and accommodation for the past 2 or so years. My friend wanted to introduce me to the German social net (since he's in a similar situation like me), however recently we're received an e-mail from a lawyer, stating that our plan for moving me out of here, is impossible for at least a couple of reasons (mostly due to us misunderstanding the law).   


&amp;#x200B;

Our plan was meant to give me a strong foundation in Germany, with basic income support, professional therapy, supervision and a place far away from my family, however we've encountered numerous obstacles.  
We've messaged various organizations (such as The Red Cross and SOS Kinderdorf), embassies and recently a lawyer directly, asking whether it's even feasible for someone without German citizenship to acquire SGB XII income support. It turns out it's not and I wouldn't even be able to legally stay in Germany at my friends place for longer than 3 months, and since I live in Poland, if I tried to argue that I'm in a hard-ship situation (despite moving to Germany consciously), I would be deported in a day or two. On top of that, to receive any income support at all, I would need to acquire citizenship, which would take me 5 years of living there, but my friends welfare isn't big enough for him to be able to take care of his and mine expenses if I were to just move in an emergency situation.

For the past year we've been moving from person-to-person, asking questions and if they replied no, moving to someone else, but we received a healthy reality check from the lawyer and decided it's time to drop this plan.  


&amp;#x200B;

Main issue I have is that I cannot really seek help here. My foster-grandparents with whom I live since birth, are extremely overprotective and if they heard about me having welfare or therapy, I'd be dead. On top of this, welfare itself in Poland, wouldn't be enough given how expensive the rent, bills and regular expenses are. Since they're very old, I've been worried for at least 8 or so years, that they might pass away any time soon, and everything is going to be dropped on me like an anvil, without any way of surviving long-term. Also, because they're my foster grandparents and legally they're practically speaking my parents, they're directly connected to the local social care center (MOPS), and I'm afraid that if I wanted to ask some questions there or ask for support, all of what I said would be redirected to them (due to the fact they already have all our contact information).   


&amp;#x200B;

Even if I did manage to get professional therapy, welfare and supportive grandparents, I'd be dead if they one day just pass away. We're already struggling to break even each month from their pension, and it's just not a very good long-term perspective.  


&amp;#x200B;

Me and my friend established that only option is receiving similar treatment to what he has in Germany, but here in Poland, and I'm wondering whether any of this would even work. I would need to acquire some sort accommodation/flat away from family and I honestly hope the rest wouldn't be that difficult, but for the moment we're e-mailing all various lawyers, social care workers and social rights activists and just not getting responses quickly enough.  


&amp;#x200B;

 Small Note: I do intend to start working and really don't want to NEET for any longer than I have to or already had, but in order for therapy or anything to work, I need to eliminate or get far away from the source of the issues.

My English is literally perfect (for an international student), I have always LOVED American people, I have always loved the opportunities this country gives everyone, I love the culture so much too. But now.. I'm 22 and post-grad. I had my college experience, I worked my ass off as a student assistant. Got all A's in all my neuroscience classes. Now I'm 22 and I have my employment authorization card... but I can't find a job. This isn't even the main problem. I just don't feel home anymore.

This place feels like home, I'm living my dream..it's unreal"" and my heart and mind would be filled with gratitude. But it no longer feels like home. I have nothing tying me to this place anymore. I graduated, I had to quit my student assistant job, I have no friends here at all, the guy I love moved back to his home country (Canada) and seems to be SO happy too. He got his own place there, he is making new friends. Obviously we're not together anymore. It didn't work out. My parents are helping me out financially, I'm a very very privileged person. I live in an oceanfront apartment, I have a nice car. My parents are okay with me ""job hunting"" for some time. But I spend all my day at home. I job hunt, I send emails, LinkedIn messages, everything. I don't hear back from a single person or company. I have an excellent reference letter and a 2-page resume. I don't see anyone and I haven't had a face to face conversation in two months. I have no friends at all, I feel so lonely. My interaction would mostly be with my coworkers, but I don't even have that anymore. I have no work or class to go to. And all I think about is this guy I love so much that seems to have found his home back in Canada. He was also someone who always had a hard time finding his ""home"".

Anger this discussion we ended the night with a proposal, we both felt incredibly happy and despite its reality quickness felt it was right and what we wanted, which I feel the need to stress.
Today we woke up, both still riding the high from this.

I don't want her too go through that and I can't help but feel like it's my fault and I still am incredibly happy to be engaged with such a wonderful woman, but the idea people are acting like this toward her because of our choice, is upsetting.

I'm not sure if this is where I should post this but I am stuck in life. I do not know what my next steps are and I feel totally lost. I feel like I've wasted so much time trying to figure things out and I don't know what to do moving forward. I'm nervous and depressed. Here is my brief story.

I graduated high school in 2010 and went to college for meteorology, which I had interest in at the time but never really knew what I was getting into. I just thought go to college and take all these courses without a real plan. I suffer from general anxiety and depression and ended up dropping out from penn state. Took some time off and went to a second college to try it again, eventually graduated in 2017 but again felt so lost and did not get a quality education in my opinion so I didn't know what to do as far as getting a job in the field. Professors just assigned you random grades for showing up and my experience was not one that could help me with employment. 

The past few years I've worked some labor jobs such as fedex and amazon and tried getting into the skilled trades like welding. I took some welding classes and enjoyed it and thought I would like it. I have had several welding jobs within the past year and I have struggled with all of them. My social skills arent that good and I have trouble making conversations with people. I am not that great of a welder but I know the basics. But I started a job recently and am really not liking the work, the pain and aches, constantly being on your feet and in weird positions. I am thinking the labor work isn't for me either. I hate the long hours and do not feel any satisfaction or enjoyment from the job so I don't know how to continue. I would like a job with more work-life balance but havent found that in the skilled trades. The laborious work just makes me miserable. Sometimes I feel like I am better off dead. 

I am now 29 years old and do not know what to do with my life. I am single and live with my family in a small house and don't have many friends, as many people have gotten married and started to have kids. Fears and anxiety have really taken over my life and perhaps prevented me from trying things. I am wondering if I should try to go back to school for something else? I enjoy math and science fields and am thinking maybe a desk job would be better for me, but I do have social anxiety and dont like speaking in front of people or anything like that. Absolutely dread it. I was thinking about jobs that math majors do since I like math, but am I too old to go back to school and spend even more money on education and loans?

I was over the moon about that because being born and raised in a small town such as the one I was in, rarely anyone ever makes it out. Ultimately, the new job was a disaster and I fucking hated it, so I quit within the first two months of working there. Stuck in the heart of San Diego, CA with no real friends or any sort of direction, I found a job on a golf course because I needed a break from everything and thought it would be easy. I ended up loving every second of it. I went on to do that for about a year until I missed home and my finances were running thin due to how expensive San Diego can be. So now I am living with my parents with no sort of direction at 28 years old. I hate the corporate life and I don't believe money is the source to happiness but being financial stable is a goal of mine. Every job I have seemed to have up until this point has been from a money driven mindset and I was deeply unhappy in every single one of those jobs. So I guess my question to you guys, is what should my next move be? I am big into working out, exercising, anything outdoors, and just staying busy because I understand the physical and more importantly, the mental health benefits it can bring. Side note: I am a huge advocate of mental health and as a sufferer of depression and anxiety as long as a chain of suicides in my family, I have the compassion and understanding for anyone that goes through the same thing. So long story short, I guess my head is in a place right now to do something that isn't money driven but more from my passions such as combing working out and mental health awareness. The thing is that we need money to live, so I am currently trying to figure out ways to monetize these passions of mine. But I've hit a road block and that's why I am asking for you guys for advice. I have thought about hiking the Appalachian Trail and raising money to spread the awareness of mental illness through series of blogs and postings along the way but it's so expensive. The list could go on with all my crazy ideas in attempts to follow my passions but it always comes back to the same thing; money. Anyways, sorry for the long posting. I hope you guys take the time to read it and give me honest feedback.

I'm 19F so I'm in college which is really busy, but I'm planning on going into medicine so I'm expecting med school and working in the field will be much busier. For context my sister has ADHD and though I haven't been diagnosed there's still a possibility I have it. I definitely have depression and anxiety though (accg to my therapist)

Anyway, I counted and I have like 15 hobbies/things that consume my time right now?? Aside from school and preparing for med school I take care of three cats by myself, play guitar in a band for school, doing driving lessons, part of 2 committees for my medicine-related organization, learning bass guitar and piano, make orchestral compositions &amp; experimenting with other types of music, sewing garments (this is important because my family sometimes depends on me for this), want to learn Mandarin Chinese (to become more connected with the Chinese side of my family) and Portuguese (gonna get a citizenship in Portugal), and on top of all that I want to start making webcomics too which is a big commitment.

Seeing the number of things I do makes my head spin. Of course it helps since I'm never bored, and most of these are optional (I can opt out when the going gets tough). Plus these all make me happy and I get sick of things sometimes and need to move onto other things (I'll ask my therapist if I have ADHD soon) and some help with my depression and anxiety. Still, the list of things I have to do and want to do gets overwhelming. I doubt any time management method in the world will allow me to do all these things consistently.

Elementary school I was labeled as gifted, then in middle school I was shoved through honors programs and being told that if I don’t step up now (as a 13 year old boy) I will hurt my future life forever. So I grinded. Until COVID hit. Being ripped from that environment for so long and being an essential worker instead, at a grocery store and later a restaurant. I really experienced a different side to life, in the grocery store I started making “business” connections as a 16 year old in a corporate setting. After a year of pandemic cashiering and online schooling, I was burnt out. School felt useless and so easy with all the tools at my disposal while laying in bed. The only highlights of my day was getting up and going to work or seeing my girlfriend which started up around this time. (I’ll call her Max for anonymity) After going through a lockdown summer with my new love,  and eventually leaving that corporate nightmare to go work in a restaurant, my life felt like the only thing that mattered was the relationship and my job. I fell in love with the restaurant industry instantly. At the age of 17 I was talking to the GM about moving up to a Manager when I turned 18, but we later found out after going through some training that I had to be 21… after some convos I’ve kinda settled on serving for now, then bartending once I graduate. During all this build up with work my relationship went with it. Until very recently, a lot of stuff got brought to my attention and it flipped my world upside down. Max had been lying to everyone and to me about me, about everyone, and even herself. It was like a spark went off one day and everyone in my life came to me with all this evidence of the awful things she did. I never suspected or imagined she would be that kind of person.

I really fucked it up. I am interviewing for an entry-level position in one of the world's biggest tech companies. It's going really well (receiving loads of good feedback!) and I am positive there will be an offer coming up in the next couple of days.

Initially, I wasn't looking for this position. A friend that is a current employee referred me and I had to quickly update my CV and adjust it to this position. While doing this, I made a horrible mistake: 

I confused the dates of my college internship and stated it was from January 2016 until July 2016 when in reality, it was one from April till June that year. I wrote down the dates of an off-the-books I had as a part-time waiter at the time.

I am panicking! Should I approach my recruiter and explain the issue before (if) they offer or wait until the company request background checks??

We've Been going strong for a good minute without any toxic behaviors and have long-term intentions. Her parents are slightly strict while my mother is overly strict

I attempted to reason with her before about this, but then she attempted to start an issue with me over an over saturated paranoid delusion that I was not doing my schoolwork. My brother had even told her, him being an adult should be trustworthy by itself as he had matured and knew how to handle the situation,  that I had done this. In the past she has also shown toxic behaviors like attempting to gas lighting me by crying when she shouldn't and should be mature about the situation. 

Currently, my girlfriend thought my mother could be reasoned with, but I'm thinking otherwise and I'm having thoughts of running away. She's basically done all she could to control almost all aspect of my life to ensure I didn't end like my brothers who were your average teenagers and wanted me to be the perfect little angel. She's forced me to homeschooling almost my entire life which has caused me social difficulties and heavy social anxiety as I have learned a few social norms later on in my life and today even.
She's even used materialistic things to try to bribe me to act better instead of using straight up punishments like taking away items or such. So She's found a way to try to manipulate me at a young age. And now, as I've gotten older She's now trying to use my emotions as a way to fish me back into her ""ever loving arms"". I know she cares about me, but the way she's severed my from social connections feels extremely unhealthy as the only people I've only ever talked to were family and the people I met online. And, slowly but surely I'm beginning to realize that my life is kind of pathetic.  But. Y'all dig into the situation and say what Y'all think best

Although if you were to look at me from a birds eye you might assume I've got my shit together. I go to the gym every day, eat healthy, take daily vitamins and health supplements I've extensively researched, have a 3.9 GPA in college, internship experience and a good resume, a good group of friends, and a nice and caring family. I feel like I have the groundwork laid out for a healthy and happy life, but I feel completely depressed, aimless and unfulfilled. I feel like I need something more, a sort of life goal if you will. Some one thing that I can truly surround myself with and pour time into. 

I've got such an urge to invest my time into one niche but I can't figure out what I want it to be, so I've ended up switching hobbies extremely frequently throughout pretty much my entire life. For a week I wanted to be a pro speed cuber, then chess player, then ping pong player, then break dancer, then physicist, etc. I just cannot make up my mind. I've become a jack of many trades because of this, but I still feel fucking horrible, I feel like I've wasted 19 years of my life, and that I'm falling behind in whatever this thing is that I haven't found yet. 

Around 4 or so months ago I decided that I'm sick of this shit and just wanted to make up my mind on a random hobby I had in the past. I spun a randomness wheel online and ended up landing on league of legends so I've been playing that for the past 4 months, constantly striving for improvement. In the end I only feel depressed as fuck and I think I regret my decision. The truth of the matter is that I'll never be as good as Faker or whoever child prodigy like GeneralSniper because I started too late on a genre and game that has existed too long. 

After evaluating the current E-sports market I feel like Riot's upcoming fighting game Project L might be a good choice because I already have some decent experience with fighting games, but even then I still feel doubt. I don't know if gaming is the category I for this interest I want to pursue. For example, although it's less enjoyable, machine learning I do find quite interesting and I feel like pursuing that would be a good way of having a healthy life with stable income, but if I'm doing that then who's to say that I won't still retain this feeling I currently have of feeling like I have the groundwork but am missing the passion project/interest. Also another goal I've had since I was 15 or so was inventing mind uploading, but that's extremely unrealistic and lofty, although I do feel like it's the goal I MYSELF intrinsically most want to achieve. 

I'm just lost as fuck, it's 2 am, I don't know what goal I should chase, will this keep happening forever or do you think I'll just grow out of it and cease to exist. Idk but if someone could give helpful advice , that would actually change my life, because this problem has been plaguing my mind for so long and it don't feel like it's going away soon.
