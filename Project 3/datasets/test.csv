"So, this might be an unusual question, but I see a lot of it in this group so I kind of wanted to post a discussion/ advice on this. I’ve always kind of wanted to try and read more blindly, because I’m always interested in stories in general- but when it comes to fic reading, sometimes it’s hard to get past not really knowing the fandom or the character backgrounds and it takes me out of the story because I get confused. Is there any advice or things I can think about or do to maybe get over that? I always want to read and review peoples fics when they post them but reading about a fandom I’m not as familiar with sometimes stops me.

"So before long, I am confident that I will be moving hours away to finally fulfill my soul and go where I feel like I belong.

"I’m 17 yrs old living in Ireland. Since I was about 14 I stopped caring about my future. I don’t want a big house and a nice car, I don’t even want a wife or kids ( but if i do get this, I will still be happy ygm). I have no ambition to do well in school and don’t want to go on to third level education. I have been struggling with my relationship between my family and find myself quickly growing apart from them. My two brothers and my mam and dad(all living together). My brother(19) struggles a lot with anger issues and depression but Me and him don’t really talk, but we still have a strong bond. My other brother(22)is horrible. He is very toxic towards my parents and his own friends. He can’t keep friends because they always realise who he is and choose to step away from him. He always talks bad about me in particular to the rest of my family and my friends. He still acts like he is perfect tho and will get upset and extremely stubborn if confronted or even questioned.

"got into an argument with my friend. we've been friends for a year and been through a lot together.

We got into a disagreement on a topic and my tone was yelling and I feel bad about that, when she was only trying to help.

I texted her, no answer. Called her. We spoke and I apologized and all she said back was ""word, cool"" and gave me dry responses. I told her my reasoning for why I said what I said and she said ""oh so do you want ME to apologize to you then?"" and basically the convo ended there.

Now I'm beating myself up for making the mistakes of arguing with her in the first place. I should have stayed quiet. I told her I was very sorry and that I love her as a friend.

"I'm sorry, I couldn't think of a better title but it is a debate that I've started to have lately with this one fic series I am writing.  I'm currently in the process of writing the second story which is multiple chapters, about four, but it is focused on a singular plot.  There are some b-plot things that I am omitting from the main story and was going to just write as a one-shot side story.  Hell tbh there was a lot I cut from the first story to make it work as a series and it is really bugging me.

Hello, my server was recently raided wherein someone spammed gore and pinged a bunch of people that were online. I'm the only admin on the server, and we've around 4,500 members. This user joined 2 weeks ago through a link on Reddit, I think.

Anyway, I would like to write an announcement apologizing for what occurred but I'm not very good at words. It's supposed to be a server for students of philosophy, and I feel like I've made a huge blunder and have a great burden, so I would like to make it a bit semi-professional. Any advice?

I just don't want them to be mad at me, think I'm incompetent, if it's not a good enough message.

" 

Yeah, decided to make a reddit post about this. A friend of mine found out that I like pairing up 'unethical' pairings—by that, including abusive pairings. Just to be clear, I don't condone it and would never want that to happen to me or anyone, but I never got the chance to tell that to them. Short context: They asked me if I supported this 'problematic' fictional pairing, and my response was similar to ""I don't mind if people shipped it as long as it's not harming anyone"",  if it was cut short.

I'm actually pretty fine if they are uncomfortable with it, yet I couldn't help but feel ashamed that they asked me a question whether I shipped this unethical pairing on a call with others I barely knew. I felt like I was backed into a corner.

I'm not so sure about turning this into a vent post, but I guess I'll explain some context again. I had to make excuses of leaving the call because I felt so uncomfortable that it was done in front of others. It didn't help that I felt some sort of disgust directed towards me and my head telling me that they would talk negatively about me to others. After all, if they did it to someone else, there's a chance they would do it to me too, right? 

It's not new that this particular friend of mine would express their discomfort of these ships in our chat, but I feel like I would've appreciated it if they talked to me privately than asking a question I didn't want to  answer in front of others I barely interacted. I just felt singled out??

So yeah, anyways, I feel ashamed about my ships that I tried working on overcoming these past few months- it went higher last night. It's funny how my confidence easily fell apart just because someone disapproved of it. I lost half of my sleeping hours feeling so stressed about what they would think of me, and whether they would talk behind my back to others. I can't assume so  much though. They did say that they were open to any opinions after I asked them if they were uncomfortable about what I said...

But it's hard for me to not doubt they wouldn't talk awfully about me. I've witnessed them participate in calling an acquitance of mine a thot, judging her for dating many people. Said acquitance is actually a nice person when I interacted with her. She has even helped me set up a date with someone else, and she's pretty sweet. But like yeah, that's where the doubt of me over them accepting to any opinions come in.

What if they go? ""Ew, this person ships this. So disgusting. I knew she was so weird."" Eesh, I can imagine my reputation getting fucked because of this person too. I felt so uncomfortable that I had to leave the group call. I don't think it's a good sign that they haven't talked to me in a day ever since last night too, so... Oh god.

But ugh, fuck. Why can't I just learn to care less about what others think...? Am I, in a way, overthinking? One of the voices in my head says yes, apparently. Any advice or experience to share?

"I have no words.

I literally am getting by day by day because I have an 18mth old to take care of (from previous marriage) - and can’t let her needs go uncared for because of my depression.

TL;DR - ghosted by my (32f) ex (30m) of 5mths two weeks before Valentine’s Day. I found out I was broken up with via social media (he never called/texted me, he removed me from his page, unfriended me and changed his status to single). He then called himself “coming back” the day after Valentine’s Day stating that he never broke up with me and why would I think that 😒 I went to the bathroom to cry (because he made me feel crazy for crying in front of him) and while there, I thought I’d take a pregnancy test. Random as all fuck, I know. And sure enough as life would fucking have it - I’m pregnant. Sad thing is, the first thing I thought of was terminating the pregnancy. I just couldn’t fathom having a baby by him and having to deal with his narcissistic behavior for the rest of my life. Anywho, I didn’t tell him for the whole day that I found out. I just stared at him.  Eventually told him that night and he feigned excitement and said how we could be a family (ummmm excuse me, not the man who just ghosted me?!) 🙄

Ohhhhhhkay, so fast forward to last Saturday- I woke up in a sweat and watched him laying next to me absolutely disgusted with myself. The the point of nausea. I realized I absolutely can not sit there and pretend I was okay with any of this. I was severely hurt, and rejected. So I spoke up. And I said what I needed from him to make this relationship to work: his time, attention, for him to stop stonewalling/gaslighting me and for him to communicate effectively. That’s it. Sad that I didn’t even say “love” smh. He kept cutting me off and replied angrily saying he treat me the way he do because I put him out before (like weeks ago after a bad argument where he called me a bad mom..etc) but WHY am I still being punished for that? I even apologized a million times. I still didn’t withhold love and affection.
Never ghosted him.. never not cared if I didn’t speak to him for days.. smh. 

So that argument happened and I simply said to him “I won’t let this be my life. Yes, I love you - but I can’t continue to love you more than I love myself. I have children to now care for and mentally/emotionally I have to be as WHOLE as I can be for them.” His response was more gaslighting and he said “If you want to leave me like people in my life usually do, then oh I get it. I’ll leave you alone.” 

Those words hurt but only because I knew he meant none of it and honestly just wanted an out - and because I gave him one, he could finally leave unscathed and with less guilt. Me saying that to him was exactly what he wanted. 

I realized after I said my speech and he didn’t even fight for me, I was going to be a single mom.

I have to now raise this man’s baby 💔

I blocked him on the every thing the moment he left my house. I washed my hands. I did have his email and emailed him a history of my appointments regarding the baby. Nothing else. Then I blocked his email. I’ll open it back up if I need to tell him anything important regarding the health of the baby.

I never felt so low.. and stupid in my life. I am so embarrassed about this that you all on Reddit are the only people I’ve told (outside of him). Can’t believe i let this master manipulator impregnate me. I am terrified to tell my family and friends. 

Finally my question: any advice you have for me? After reading the dumpster fire that is my life?

I really don't know what I want to do in life. i am 26 and I really don't feel as though I have any talent or goals set. I always have thoughts that I am not good enough, and when I don't see progress or anything lining up I get discouraged and give up. I really wish I had my stuff together and knew what I have wanted so I can work for it little by little. I feel like I'm trapped inside my head and don't or will ever see a way out. Since i was a kid i never payed attention in school. i always just daydreamed of random stuff and never did my homework or cared. i just liked watching tv, playing video games and hanging out with friends. it didn't help that i was very shy and quiet with strangers and classmates so  i never wanted to do anything outside my comfort level. I always felt self conscious about my looks and what people thought about me making my years a waste as i didn't want to try anything new. i wish i could have played piano or guitar or focused on my writing and drawing as that is something i loved doing. now I'm in university and i am taking too long and still cant focus on my school work or organizing my duties and time management. on top of that i am 30,000 in debt. have a full time job and a second early morning job making it harder to do school work and hobbies. living in the bay are makes it even harder when everything is much mire expensive. i just feel as though there isn't a job for me out here that i will like doing  I really feel like I'll end up disappointing me and my family.

"I'm 20 years old. I always did well in school, I played baseball, got good grades and had big aspirations, but somewhere along the way I began struggling with depression and anxiety. Going into college as a freshman in 2020 I struggled with online school and keeping myself on track. This caused my depression to grow and I eventually quit school, and lost all of my friends in the process. To become productive again I worked full time for over a year, and was in line to start a new job which eventually fell through. Today I'm in the process of finding a new job, which hasn't been successful so far. Some days I wake up motivated to succeed in this life, but most days I question if anything will ever feel motivating or inspiring. I'm incredibly grateful that I have a roof to live under and a family, but my hopes and aspirations aren't there anymore. While I could see myself going back to school, I have absolutely no idea what I want to get out of this life or what sort of career could fulfill me. I feel completely exiled from my peers, and the my relationship with family has become extremely toxic. I've spent time programming and learning various skills in my free time, but nothing I do seems to spark any sort of motivation in me. I despise feeling this way and I feel guilty for complaining so much when I've been given so much opportunity, but I can't help the emptiness I feel. Nothing that I can possibly think of in my future gives me the desire to give life my all. It's not that I'm afraid or I feel like I'm inadequate, I just feel incredibly depressed and hopeless about life in general. I don't want to spend a life worrying about politics and my income and what people are obsessing over online or anything superficial. None of that feels important to me. Although I can't say what really does feel important anymore.

If you've read so far, I'd just like to ask; for anyone who has ever struggled with life or what they want to do someday, what helped you find that answer? How do I get out of this hole I feel as if I'm lost in? If there was a step by step guide on how to succeed in life I'd be glad to follow it. I've learned from my mistakes but it just feels like it's too late now. My life just feels like a bunch of wasted opportunity, and dead end dreams. And honestly, I despise the idea of being chained to a 9-5 like I am at the moment, gradually perspiring only to go on doing something I despise doing. I know I can't continue on the path I'm on now so please somebody offer me any advice. 

I never intended on spewing these thoughts online but I can't take it anymore. I can't take another day mulling around aimlessly until it's time to go to sleep again. I just want to do something spectacular with my life. As I said I've learned from my mistakes and I'd do anything just to find what I want in life, but nothing I pursue seems to be for me.

"Hello!

I had a very rough 2021. 

I lost everything I had, my beautiful girlfriend and our future plans, my rented condo, my jobs and my mental health has suffered.

I’m currently sitting in a discounted hotel room with my dog, a can of beans and my business plans and dreams to succeed.

I just snapped out of a terrible depression which lasted nearly 7 months. 

Maybe it was the spring, fresh air and sunshine.

So I’m starting over with a little debt, big plans and $0.04 in my bank account. I’m not sure what I’ll eat tomorrow. I sold everything I had to survive to this point.

Today I woke up and snapped out of my rut. I’ve been busy all day trying to get another job and money for my start up. I want to work on my dream again.  

I only have a coach bag that is sentimental that my ex bought me for my birthday and a Movado Bold I bought myself after my divorce to remind me that time is our most valuable asset.

Both are valuable but sentimental to me and I will take them with me.

I need a small business startup loan ASAP to get my new business venture up and running.

I am an entrepreneur who ran a successful tree business for 7 years before it fell apart after an injury.

I want to expand my business model to include more services and hire qualified employees.

I tried the government of Canada website for a small business loan.

I need something ASAP. Any avenue to get back on my feet.

In terms of everything else, I pray everyday for that woman back in my life. 

To be what I once was and to succeed.

Has anyone else been in this position? 

I’m not suicidal, I would have done it by now. 

I want to have more hope and inspiring stories from others who have spring-boarded off the bottom.

I’d like to stop washing my clothes in a bathtub and get some real food in me. I’d also like to take my dog for a nice grooming, she needs some love.

Thank you in advance for your advice and thoughts.

Have a great day everyone!",Starting over at 39 with nothing in the bank.,t7gcnz,LifeAdvice,Heyhaveyougotaminute,1,1.0,0,1,/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t7gcnz/starting_over_at_39_with_nothing_in_the_bank/,1646507038,1,2022-03-05 22:03:58-05:00,2022-03-05,22:03:58,3,5,22,"Starting over at 39 with nothing in the bank.

I just snapped out of a terrible depression which lasted nearly 7 months. 

Maybe it was the spring, fresh air and sunshine.

So I’m starting over with a little debt, big plans and $0.04 in my bank account. I’m not sure what I’ll eat tomorrow. I sold everything I had to survive to this point.

Today I woke up and snapped out of my rut. I’ve been busy all day trying to get another job and money for my start up. I want to work on my dream again.  

I only have a coach bag that is sentimental that my ex bought me for my birthday and a Movado Bold I bought myself after my divorce to remind me that time is our most valuable asset.

Both are valuable but sentimental to me and I will take them with me.

I need a small business startup loan ASAP to get my new business venture up and running.

I am an entrepreneur who ran a successful tree business for 7 years before it fell apart after an injury.

I want to expand my business model to include more services and hire qualified employees.

I tried the government of Canada website for a small business loan.

I need something ASAP. Any avenue to get back on my feet.

In terms of everything else, I pray everyday for that woman back in my life. 

To be what I once was and to succeed.

Has anyone else been in this position? 

I’m not suicidal, I would have done it by now. 

I want to have more hope and inspiring stories from others who have spring-boarded off the bottom.

I’d like to stop washing my clothes in a bathtub and get some real food in me. I’d also like to take my dog for a nice grooming, she needs some love.

Thank you in advance for your advice and thoughts.

Have a great day everyone!",382,1995,start bank hello rough lose beautiful girlfriend future plan rent condo job mental health suffer m currently sit discount hotel room dog bean business plan dream succeed snap terrible depression last nearly month maybe spring fresh air sunshine m start little debt big plan bank account m sure ll eat tomorrow sell survive point today wake snap rut ve you day try job money start want work dream coach bag sentimental ex buy birthday movado bold buy divorce remind time valuable asset valuable sentimental need small business startup loan asap new business venture run entrepreneur run successful tree business year fall apart injury want expand business model include service hire qualified employee try government canada website small business loan need asap avenue foot term pray everyday woman succeed position m suicidal want hope inspiring story spring board d like stop wash clothe bathtub real food d like dog nice grooming need love thank advance thought great day

"18m, was in a serious relationship with something I loved for 3+ years. They were extremely special, and we went through a lot together. A year and a half in, she had cheated and broken up because a friend of hers had told her to do so. I found out that they had spread rumours about me. My girlfriend had showed me texts where she was telling a lot of her personal friends that I was ugly. That I had talked to her and treated her like a piece of shit' I ma an extremely introvertive, quiet person. She was someone who I had felt comfortable around. I could act myself, and I thought that was okay. I thought I was doing good by taking care of her. I thought I did my absolute best to treat her like the only girl in the world. At that time, I was begging her to stop talking to this guy. She did, and we got back together. She expressed how she needed a break from the stress that my family would bring. We were both around a lot of traumatic events and stress. Once back together, things seemed to be okay. She ended up moving into a foster home in another city. I would visit often. Her foster mother did not like me. She expressed she would do everything possible to break us apart. Eventually, her foster mom was so willing to do whatever it took, she lied to DHS caseworkers, telling them that I had stolen an unspecified amount of money, and that I had broken her TV. She has cameras in every room of the house. The last day I was there, her TV croaped out randomly. It died. I was with her, and she had asked me for help to see what was going on. But she turned it into a lie saying I did that to her TV. I left, and didn't know that would be my last time. From there, things became long distance. The relationship was okay, but I felt something was wrong. My girlfriend wouldn't talk to me the same way. She didn't talk to me as much. She told me one day she met this cool stoner guy, who she was just friends with. Later on, she told me she no longer loved me, and left. She went to go do weed, acid, and meth/heroine with the stoner guy, who was her dealer. She was such a kind, soft soul who had seen so much, more than anyone should have. I treated her to what I thought the best I could. I don't want to forget her or move, because I feel like I am giving up on her. I've become horribly depressed. I've missed so much school. My grades have gotten terrible. The bad things she's said have stuck with me so deeply, so the point where I have trouble maintaining eye contact in a conversation because I hold her so highly.

"Kay, to start out, please note that I am well aware of FFN's guidelines that say you can't post anything with exceptionally explicit content. I also have all of my stories posted to Ao3 as well and know that the site doesn't have the same rules as FFN. I'm also not hating on this person (who will remain nameless) but rather I question their life choices...

I've known about that rule for years. Since I started writing fanfiction when I was 12 over a decade ago. And in that time frame, I have seen many - MANY - stories with explicit content that have been around for *years.* Some well written, some not. I just posted my first one-shot about a week ago and I am very proud of it.

Well, today I get another Review and it says...

&gt; While the writing quality of your story is good in terms of spelling and grammar, please note this part of the Content Guidelines:  
&gt;  
&gt;""Please note FanFiction does not accept explicit content, Fiction Rating: MA, and the rating is only presented for reference.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Remove all of the detailed descriptions of physical interaction of sexual or violent nature in this story if you want it to remain at this site, or upload it to a site where ""Fiction MA"" content is allowed like Archive Of Our Own.

Turns out, this person literally spends all their time reading through content, fishing for stuff they can report and adding it to their community that is specifically geared toward reporting. Now, I'm aware that there have been stories deleted from the site do to breaking this rule. But, I think if the moderators *REALLY* cared, there wouldn't be stories in this community that were posted in 2003 that are still around. *MAYBE* if they actually cared they would look through this community and go through the **4,000+ stories** this person has allegedly read. So, it is very possible some of you might have the same comment on one of your stories.

If reporting fanfiction helps them sleep at night, so be it. I just find if utterly confusing that someone would spend so much time going through SO MANY stories just to report them. It seems like such a huge waste of time to police the site when they are just an average user and don't have any real power. If they had any real power, there wouldn't be 4,000+ stories in their community that have yet to be taken down in the last 8 years that the community has been around.

If anything, I would think them creating this community full of explicitly sexual/violent content would have the opposite effect. Even I was like, ""Oh? Adult content all in one place, neat!"" It's a place where people who like that content can flock to and know exactly what's there.

"Hello strangers of the internet. I am struggling a little bit and the first place I surprisingly thought of to go for advice was to checkout reddit. 

A few days ago my mom called me, pretty much in a nut shell saying how my girl friend posted some tiktok and made it sound terrible, end of the world, etc. She also mentioned that my dad was also ashamed. Pretty much at the end she said I should ""reassess"" who my girlfriend is. I didn't see the tiktok, but after this weird phone call I decided to look for myself. It is **literally** a short video with a clip that says near the middle of it, ""suck my dick you stupid b\*\*\*\*"". This was literally the tiktok video that my mom was referring to.

&amp;#x200B;

Now don't get me wrong, we have all heard, ""Watch what you post on the internet, it could come creeping up back at you."" But come on, this is TikTok. I have seen many cringy inappropriate videos on it, did any of those people end up failing in life cause of it? Most likely not. 

  
I can see why they have their opinions on the video but come on. Are you really gonna hate my girlfriend over a short tiktok? I almost feel like they are attacking her over it. It sucks cause I am in college and everything just kinda feels like it is attacking me at once. 

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend is talking to them about it and everything, and told me to worry about school and not on the drama. But I just can't get it out of my head.

"It happened a hour ago. Somebody left this comment on one of my NSFW works on Archive of Our Own and it really hurt my feelings:

The person told me that the story sucks and said that I sound like a child. They also put three disgust emotes before the comment. I can't believe somebody has to attempt to force me to stop writing smut. I even checked their account and they haven't posted any stories, so they may be a new user. But anyway, I have to approve their comment and reply back to them saying that this is my account and this is my stories. I mean, only the author, me, have the power to create whatever story I created. I told them also on why they leave a negative comment instead of just hating the story and read something else. Finally, I concluded the reply hy saying that I will be deleting their comments if they keep making more negative comments on my stories.

Then I deleted the comment plain simple. This is why I hate very negative comments on my stories.

Update #1: They posted another comment on the same story. They gave me a 0/10 for ""bad writing, forgettable story (if they can call this a story) and terrible, god-awful smut that looks like it was written by a middle schooler."".

Instead of replying to them again, I deleted their comment.

Update #2: They left another comment again, this time, a different story that me and my friend did together. They insulted me even more. The troll called me a whiney ass piece of trash. They even called me a dumbass and a IRL bitch. They told me to stop writing and I suck, as a person and my writing. Finally, they concluded their comment as telling me again that my smut sucks and I will be a virgin forever. This is very rude and unhelpful. As usual, I deleted the comment.

"Im lately thinking a little about someone . I saw that person in February 2019 for the last time . It was very different . I won't call it a crush cuz I never thought about this person . I would say it was 'situational attention-seeking' from both sides . We just talked twice in real life (never texted) and i always tried to cut it short . I dont know why .... maybe I was not comfortable . I wanted that person to crave for me (seriously) but this didn't happen . This person's house is just 4 km away from my house but We never met after Feb 2019 . Honestly I know 'I don't have any feelings for this person' and neither he has . Whatever we had earlier is crazily complicated . We never liked each other (really) but were too much interested in each other . What I really feel about that person is .... His wife would be really lucky but I dont feel bad about it . I want to see him just once , I don't know why . This person is just too much focused on his career and I really admire this .   
So , right now the situation is like Im 18 and im home for really a few months and all set to go to college which is far away and after that my future is nowhere even close to the place im from , neither culturally nor geographically . In short , these are just last few months Im here . People meet old people on dating apps like Tinder and all that but there is no chance that i'll ever use them . On Instagram , I know that person's username and he knows mine but I'll never send him request and i don't think he'll ever . See , tbh , I don't want much . I just want to see him once from a distance . Nope , I don't want to make any relationship , any friendship , I don't want to talk to him , I don't even want to make an eye contact or smile at him or anything like this . Honestly , Im past everyone and everything now . I just don't know Why I want this to happen !

Why do you think I want to see him before leaving this place ? Is this natural ?

"I’m 20, in college, sophomore year, below average GPA. I cheat on anything I can, never study, don’t pay attention in class. I have no career prospects and no interests. I’m ignorant, and when it comes to school I’m especially lazy. However, I do genuinely enjoy work over the summer (according to my friends and most sane and rational human beings, nobody is supposed to really enjoy their part-time summer jobs at a restaurant). 

I don’t want to be in college. My dilemma here is that I’m smart enough to realize that if I dropout I have nothing else to do. I have no alternative, but at the same time I also have no idea what I’m doing in college other than taking a bunch of introductory courses because I’ve changed my major 17 times and wasting everyone’s time. 

Part of me wonders what the hell all those bozos in high school did after high school graduation, probably nothing. I seem to be boarding their same boat, it’s just that I’m in college too so it’s complicated. Part of me just wants to work, get a roommate, but then the other half of my brain says “You can’t fucking do that the rest of your life, you need a career, dipshit.”

"So! The current project I'm working on is a big ol' crossover, think Super Robot Wars, more than 10 different canon series coming together for crossover plots and a big Crisis Crossover style main threat they have to deal with. Long, long fic, all things said and done. Completely putting aside that most people would advise me not to write that kind of thing,   


I wanted to give readers who do want to get into it without necessarily knowing every series involved some resource to get up to snuff. I wanted to write character profiles! Character's name, age, appearance (if they are a non-canon character, or their sense of style has changed meaningfully since the time of their home series), history, and their 'kit', you know, what they can *do.* Which leads me to my problem:  


I can't really just put the profiles at the start or end of each chapter they appear in, huh? I value surprise value a little too much, so I would definitely not do them at the start and say outright which characters debut in a given chapter. I don't want to put them at the end, either; that isn't very helpful in the chapter itself. Optimally, it'd be best to be able to hotlink the first appearance of a character's name to these little profiles, so people who have no idea who this person is can give it a look if they so desire, and it's completely unobtrusive to the people who do know that series, right?

Hi I’m (F26) and my boyfriend is (M29) we met when I was 14 he was 17. When we first met we would have sex about 3/2 times a day or every chance we would get (I lost my virginity to him) but that lasted about 8 months then I saw a huge shift he did not want to have sex at all !!! I would throw myself at him and  nothing. It started with, im so tired, I don’t feel good, I have diarrhea, then it got worse and worse, I would go to sleep in full nude and he would get upset saying I’m so desperate and that I need help because that’s all I think about, he would accuse me of just using him for sex and I truly did think it was me for a while, at that point we would have sex once a month.  I would literally cry when we would finally have sex because it was so rare it was the only time I felt loved which idk if that’s normal or healthy but it is what it is that how I felt at the time. This continued to happen from when I was 16-23 that’s when our sex life was horrible !!! I hated it I felt so ugly and unattractive and he’s not very affectionate at all which is why sec was important because I got hugged and kissed ect… so I have been neglected a lot emotionally but I would brush it off as “ I have to respect his choice” in the movies you always see the girlfriend or wife saying she’s tired or not in the mood so I thought it would be fair if the roles would be reversed, I thought that maybe he just had issues. I had thought about him cheating but never found anything. So when I was 24 I started to heal from past trama and I opened up to him about me being molested when I was younger and days after my confession he confessed to me that he was raped when he was 8 years old by someone at his school I obviously broke down crying and didn’t push to get more info out I just followed his lead with opening up. So that when I started to think what if he’s gay ? But I feel shitty for thinking that 😔 because he was raped and it wasn’t his choice I don’t know much but I wonder if that confused him or if that situations brings shame to sec I also have thought about him being ASEXUAL but idk idk what do you guys think ?","My boyfriend sex drive has been low since I met him 13 years ago, is he gay ?",sqdngn,LifeAdvice,Rich_soul143,1,1.0,0,8,/r/LifeAdvice/comments/sqdngn/my_boyfriend_sex_drive_has_been_low_since_i_met/,1644624330,1,2022-02-12 03:05:30-05:00,2022-02-12,03:05:30,2,5,3,"My boyfriend sex drive has been low since I met him 13 years ago, is he gay ?

&gt;!“I’ll rip your jaw from your head if you don’t shut up.” Diamondhead hissed, turning his arm into a blade. The Four Arms started breathing heavily, finally realizing that he was in danger. “You know, I’ve actually never done this before. I have no idea how hard it will be to cut your arms off. Thank you for being my Guinea pig.” He looked into the Four Arms eyes and saw nothing but fear; he almost felt bad. Almost. He started cutting into the arm at the joint, figuring that’d be the most accessible place to sever it. The process was slow going; his skin and muscles were very resistant to cutting. He added serrations to the blade before going at it again, this time it was easier. !&lt;

&gt;!He sawed his way through skin, muscle, and bone. It took a minute of straight sawing just to get to the bone. “Wow, you are resilient,” Diamondhead said. The Four Arms screamed and cried, begging Diamondhead to stop. The arm finally came off, landing on the ground with a thud.!&lt;

&gt;!“Please, I’m sorry. Just stop.” The Four Arms sobbed.!&lt;

&gt;!“You’re not sorry,” Diamondhead said coolly. “If I let you go now, you would have learned nothing. You’ll get more goonies, and then you’ll have them kill again. No, I’m not going to let that happen.” He mercilessly sawed off the other arm, ignoring the screams and pleas for mercy. When he finished, he released the diamonds holding him down. The Four Arms fell to the ground, sobbing.!&lt;

" 

I would like to sum the whole story by the most important events, and since I am in a very bad place now, any suggestions are welcome.

I lost my father at 19 due to lungs cancer, and since then a rough 10 years passed.

Diagnosed with anxiety disorder and depression. Got pills for that, so I can concentrate on my studies.

I finished college, got a job... Living with a sick mother (she was also depressed).

At 26, met a really nice girl, and we started a relationship. At this point, I was still on pills.

I was unaware of my feelings, although I tried to articulate if I love her or just liked her because of her character. I couldn't figure it out no matter how hard I tried. She on other hand loved me. A lot. I also got the feeling that through our relationship, I was the one who is pushing both of us forward. She was always a little too fragile for real life. So sometimes, I felt exhausted, I got mom's situation, work, and just got a feeling that something is not right. It was not a boring relationship, but she was a dreamer (in a nice way), and just wanted to stay home, or go on walks. But I got a feeling that no matter how much I told her about things that I miss in our relationship, she couldn't figure out a way...

Mom got sick, and because of her condition doctor told us he could not perform surgery on her aneurism and basically we went home waiting for her to die.

My girlfriend was still the same, and one day after a 1-hour ride to her town just to see her, and not talk about anything, I went home. I called her and told her that she just do not understand how much effort I put into the relationship, and since I got a dying mother at home, I do not have enough relationship energy. She took it pretty bad.

Months passed and mom died from aneurism after she fell and broke a hip. It was a lot worse, and more painful losing her than my dad. After all, I was now alone in this world at 27. My family didn't call, friends were all busy, and I felt really lonely. And COVID also started.

My ex started calling me, and we started casually seeing each other. I knew that she was trying to get back together, and I didn't have anything against that. I just felt empty. And I was still on the meds for anxiety and depression.

She got a job in my town, so she asked me if we could be roommates. I knew that was just an attempt to get closer with me, but again I didn't have anything against it. Soon, she figured out I am emotionally unavailable and got back home after a few months. And then, for a few months, we didn't hear from each other.

In the past year, I was on some kind of a spiritual/emotional journey. I went to the other psychotherapist, and he was pretty good. I also went to church and talk to a priest, even if I was an atheist my whole life. Things got a lot clearer. I realized I was undeveloped in some ways, emotionally. That may be some people and friends around me got more serious about their lives as I was fighting my battles. I know everyone has their own pace, but I threw my ego and looked at my flaws. Also, I stopped using my pills (okay, as I write down I see where the plot is haha).

And as a final thing, I had a mini religious experience. I started going to church, mainly to talk with a priest that has a lot of life experience. And one day, I was in a church and started crying like a baby. I didn't cry for 15 years. Everything just got simple, and I could see everything wrong with my life.

I went home and started writing (I write poetry as a hobby, a really bad one. But it helps me with my emotional life). Song after song, I wrote about 15 in 3 days. I am not an ignorant person to that point that I do not see that stopping with my pills for anxiety got me a little emotionally exposed. I got that. But I also got that I was too long on the medication and that I missed so much of life. I was so emotionally unavailable that I couldn't see all her attempts to get back with me, and herlove. She tried more than a year to prove to me that she was willing to change and that she loves me. And I saw clearly that I love her. I was full of hope, and I thought, that's it.

I started writing to her, letter, song, then another song... And then I called her, I wanted to send her all of those. And then, here comes karma from a title - she tells me that she is in a relationship and that she loves that person, and plans a future together.

It was like a sky was falling. First time in my life, I found out what means when people tell you they can't feel their legs from shock. In less than 3 days I found out what is wrong with my life, that I am now alone in this world in every possible way, and that it hurts that someone I broke up with and did so wrong to her, is moving on with life. While I do not know what to do, and where to go with mine.",Karma + bad luck.

"like 2/3 months ago i cut the friendship with my only friend i would actually hang out with and talk to on a daily basis. i dont regret it because if the friendship doesnt work it doesnt and i dont care about that aspect. but i do miss having friends a lot because i would have fun you know doing stuff together. i dont go to school, im planning on going again this september, but because of that i also dont really have a social life. rn im still looking for a job.

anyways the thing i feel stuck with is just that my life is kinda really boring right now. i still do stuff like going to the gym and i have driving lessons every week, i also go to therapy. the days just kind of feel the same. its not that i do the same thing every single day but the structure of my days are exactly the same. in weekends i do stuff with my family but i dont always feel like doing that too yk. im also kinda shy and very introverted so making friends is even harder i feel like. and like, where do i even make friends if i dont go to school. also its not like i have zero friends but its just friends you see once a year yk. or like u dont always have daily contact and its just more of a background friendship. and i wish i had like even one good best friend or like a little group of 3/4 which we'd hang out with weekly.

"[WILL BE DELETING THIS IN A FEW HOURS IN CASE PEOPLE WHO IM TALKING ABOUT HERE FIND IT] 

The tl;dr is the title, but this is a long ass story to be able to explain why I want to do this bc im aware the title just makes me sound like a complete asshole.

(Yes the following is all relevant to the question, its much needed backstory for this post.)

So I'm 19, and I normally live with my mum. I had my entire teenage years up until this year stolen away from me, first by severe and crippling mental illness, then by severe physical illness that stopped me from being able to go to school or any other education. 

At 18 I decided to try going to college, but that was when the pandemic was happening, and I had no idea how COVID would effect me with my illness and none of my classmates or teachers gave a shit about COVID rules which made me feel incredibly unsafe, so I quit. When I told my dad and stepmum I quit college, they offered to let me work at the place my stepmum works at for a 3 month training period, but I would have to live with them for that time, and I agreed to it, fully expecting it to only be 3 months of living with them, and then I'd be able to work from my mums remotely.

That did NOT happen. It turned out that going into the office once a week was not something that was just required for training, and was in fact just part of the job. Basically meaning in order to keep the job, I had to move in with them permanently. This was NOT something I wanted to do at all. I love living with them, but I also love living with my mum more as she lives closer to the rest of my family, and I absolutely hate being away from my family.

I've been here almost a year now, and I really just don't want to waste my official last teenage year living in a place where I don't want to live, away from most of my family, away from my pets, and away from my only friend.

But someone else at work quit, and whats even worse is my dad's close friend died, and I feel like I'd be a horrible person to leave now. But at the same time, the clock is ticking. It's March already, I started working for this company last April so I planned to quit and go home this April, which is literally next month.

I haven't felt so fucking depressed in ages, I've been here way too long and everyone's started to think I want to permanently live here. But I really don't. I think I left it way too late.

Should I be a selfish asshole and quit and go home next month, or do I stay for longer even though I feel like absolute shit, incredibly depressed and am constantly fighting the urge to relapse on self harming? Please someone help. Even one comment is fine. I just need some form of guidence.",Is it selfish to quit my job and move out if my dads friend just died and someone else just quit at work?,t8funj,LifeAdvice,catwithheadinbread,1,1.0,0,1,/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t8funj/is_it_selfish_to_quit_my_job_and_move_out_if_my/,1646623327,1,2022-03-07 06:22:07-05:00,2022-03-07,06:22:07,3,0,6,"Is it selfish to quit my job and move out if my dads friend just died and someone else just quit at work?

I would still continue chasing my goals even in university.

B) I just start working a minimal wage job and chase my goals  while I feel like a failure **(until it starts paying enough that  I can quit my job)** cause I won't be tending higher education.

"So, there was that awesome post a while ago about how some of us are older fans, and it got me thinking about my own experience. I’m in my mid 30s and I’ve been pretty deep into a bunch of fandoms for half of my life. My active engagement with fandom, however, has decreased pretty dramatically in the past ten years (moved halfway across the world, got married, got a PhD, a job, an interest in community projects and activism, etc…) the kind of experience I think a lot of people go through when they transition out of their 20s. For years, I actually thought I was done with fandom and fan fiction writing for good, but … I was wrong. I recently reactivated my Tumblr to keep up with my current fandom and posted my first serious fic in ten years. It really made me realize how much I missed the whole experience, but now I feel pretty torn.

Last year I lost my best-friend and brother to accidental suicide, and I spent a lot of last year drinking to try to numb the pain of that loss, and after some regrettable decisions and pain I’ve been contemplating quite a bit,

First One was to leave the job he and I worked together and we saw a lot of…well not good things, I can still see and smell those things when I close my eyes

And I decided it was time to leave the job and the second one

Well the second one is the one I’m struggling with, it’s quitting drinking, he and I would drink a lot together and he was drinking the night of the accident, and so I’ve been thinking maybe it was time for me to give up drinking for good, but I’m torn on this, quit and try to enjoy life, or continue and keep the traditions we created together over 8 years together going.

Last year I lost my best-friend and brother to accidental suicide, and I spent a lot of last year drinking to try to numb the pain of that loss, and after some regrettable decisions and pain I’ve been contemplating quite a bit,

First One was to leave the job he and I worked together and we saw a lot of…well not good things, I can still see and smell those things when I close my eyes

And I decided it was time to leave the job and the second one

Well the second one is the one I’m struggling with, it’s quitting drinking, he and I would drink a lot together and he was drinking the night of the accident, and so I’ve been thinking maybe it was time for me to give up drinking for good, but I’m torn on this, quit and try to enjoy life, or continue and keep the traditions we created together over 8 years together going. What advice would y’all give me?

"So i'm 30 and have been in my role as a 100% account manger based in Southern California since April of 2020. I make $60K and i'm not passionate about the role, but the job is relatively easy with not too much work (Need to work and be available 8-5 but only 4-5 of actual work throughout the day).

I don't like California (except the Sierra Nevada area) and I love traveling so the past 5 months i've done just that. Ive traveled as far as North Carolina and back but mainly been in Colorado and Montana as I love the mountains and national parks out here. Ive been doing week long airbnbs in people houses which have worked out great going city to city and national park to national park on the weekends. During the week its just a normal work week for mw wherever I am. Work, cook, gym, etc. 

But it's tiring. I think the worst part is that I have no home base. The thing is I cant sign a lease anywhere because there have been talks for months about bringing us back in the office part time 2-3x a week. When they finally bring us back in, I am 100% going to ask them to stay remote. I don't want to go back into the office. I first have to get over the hurdle of letting them have me work remote (or doing a hotelling schedule maybe with me coming back in a few days a month I would be open to) and then I have to make sure they have tex setups in the state im in (I heard they only have tax setups in California, Arizona, and Oregon).

I know this next part is a good problem to have, but my Uncle is going to buy me a house up to $450,000 anywhere I want to be when I settle down and pick an area I like with a job. He tells me no rush (literally can wait years). I obviously cant pick a place right now to buy let alone even sign a lease because they could bring me back in the office literally any day, could be next week could be in 6 months. 

Beyond that, regarding macro life situation, I am having fun traveling, but i'm 30, have hit almost every major area of the country that I want to explore, and want to obviously eventually get married or so by the age of 35ish. I feel like I am kind of wasting time a bit. I mean I am working, making money, saving money, supporting myself, but I am not building a home base or anything. I go to the gym, relatively good looking, but have gotten so used to doing my own thing and traveling and hiking that I havent been on a date in over a year. Kind of feel I am not doing the responsible thing. 

And even if I could pick somewhere, I don't know where. I love the mountains and dislike cities, which is what is drawing me to the Colorado and Montana area. But $450K, even all cash, can only get you so much in those area because they are so popular. I do like living in open space a bit away from the city but there are 2 problems with this. 1. Regarding work and future work, I don't know how long I can sustain working remote, and even If they do give me the go ahead with 100% remote, what happens if something happens with that job, I would be out of luck living out of a job market. How do people living away from a major city or even living in a smaller city do it? Should i plan accordingly based on future job roles? I have account management and recruiting experience although I dont like recruiting. 

2. And finally, I feel like I am living a lifestyle thats just my own without regard for the future. And if I get a place not near a big city where I can just hike and travel while working remotely, I'll end up 45 and single which I dont want.

" Context time. I (25m) have settled on cutting my family in their entirety once and for all. This comes after a long history of mental abuse and childhood trauma that I have tried my best to process without the help of therapy, but as a result has left me with a very apathetic and “it is what it is” outlook on life.

The final “nail in the coffin” so to speak happened a few days ago. A good friend of mine (27m) who has a younger brother (21m) has always been very close with my younger brother (21m) and have always been seen as a duo for trouble. A few months ago, the terrible two got into some rather intense legal trouble since they both committed a rather bad crime together. This led to my friends brother to “narc” on my brother, whereas my brother kept quiet.

My family have, and consistently continue to have a very “anti police” and “anti authority” outlook. In plain terms, they live a “ghetto” life. No respect for authority and “all police lovers deserve to be killed”. I am cut from a very different cloth to them and understand life’s great rule - play stupid games, and win stupid prizes. I’ve never had issues with authority, and spoke as I’m spoken to. I understand that police are just doing their job, and if you don’t want to be arrested, don’t commit crime.

My friends family have never mistreated me, have clothed me, fed me, and given me shelter when my family wouldn’t. As a result, regardless of whether my friends brother “opened his mouth”, I understand that I no longer need to like him, but out of respect for my friend, I still remain civil with his brother and his family. I do not represent my family, nor does my friend represent his. It is a mutual understanding that we both share. I still have my friend and his family visit quite regularly, whereas my family doesn’t come anywhere near me because of this fact.

This all come to fruition a few days ago when my friend and his family were visiting. Because I live locally to my family, they are aware of these visits, and for lack of a better word “keep tabs” on who is at my home. they decided it was in their best interest to pay me a visit while my friend was here with his family to “exact revenge” because of their ghetto mentality. This erupted into a screaming war of me kicking everyone out of my home, making a mockery out of myself in front of the entire neighborhood as I screamed the street down.

After composing myself and processing my anger, I decided that it was in my best interest to cut off my entire family, and sent them a mature and composed message with my reasons. The message, of course was responded with a load of “you don’t understand family loyalty” and “you’re sticking up for people who deserve to be put down”.

Over the years, my family have stolen from my home, guilt tripped me, and disapproved of every positive influence within my life. I have kept my silence and said time and time again “it is what it is. They are family.”

I am starting to feel a sense of guilt within my decision. I am in charge of my entire family’s paperwork, emails, appointment dates, etc. I keep track of their lives for them, and without my constant reminders there is every chance they could lose their social security income, which is their only source.

Over the last few days, my family have been messaging my friends and other members of the family and bringing more and more abuse to me and my home. This has had a VERY heavy strain on my mental state and general wellbeing and I am at a loss of what to do.

I want to move away as far as I can where nobody can find me and enjoy peace within myself, but the problem is that is just not a possibility. I have no job, I have no driver's license, and no savings. I do a bit of freelancing things on the side that helps bring in some money, but nothing absolutely groundbreaking that would allow me to just up and move tomorrow. My family live locally to me, and because they know they can no longer get through to me, they have resorted to messaging others, who in turn message me, essentially getting people to do their dirty work for them.

I have deactivated social media, but obviously phone numbers are being given out and once again it just circles around. I don't exactly want to go to the police about the event and would rather deal with it myself without resorting to ""lowering to their level"" or pettiness. I am above that, and I know I am.

"Hello guy, english is not my first language so please pardon any grammatical errors.

So im 22(M) and I live in a country with a super high population, I am writing this and I dont even know if I would get a response, it will be out of my conscious mind that I didnt!

I am at a stage of life where I dont know what to do anymore, my father loaned around 20k$ with our only apartment as a collatral and spent all my education money (20k$) in his buissness plan which was a total doom, now I am in 2nd sem of my college pursuing an animation degree, I dont work as I dont get time to do so after college and assignments, its a rigorous 4 year degree, he even loaned my moms jewelleries on some debt he has piled up on top of that (10k$) so my family is in a total debt of 50k$ in a country where even earning 20k$ per year is an achievement. My mom cries everyday and its a pain to see

I have been given an option by my moms side of family to move to their state and move around eye machines to different doctors to earn money and pay off debt, the pay is around 15k $ per year not including any amenities like food and housing. 

I really dont know what I should do, continue with my degree while piling more debts and handouts from family members or just go into this machine business. I am sad most of the days and I dont know if I would earn good money after this degree.

If I work with my moms side of family I wont be able to get an education for atleast 5-6 years. I dont want to see my mom sad, I dont want to waste my life thinking I didnt do something while I had a chance. I just want my parents to be happy and live retirement.

Sometimes I think I should just kms and get all these problems over with, I got a bad disease when I was young so I wasn't able to pursue education early on, I am good with computers, animation and design thinking but I dont really see if that would let me earn a lot where median pay for these jobs are 10k$ per year.

"First off, I know that obviously since someone is offended, I need to stop making jokes. I understand that. And I'm more than willing. I never meant to offend anyone.

I'm a white male, but I never in my dreams would want to offend anyone. I work at a public library, and I've put my foot in my mouth three times in last week. I've been there about 8 months now without incident.

The first time, my supervisor was messing with a lock. I was ADD growing up, medicated, and I found that ever since I went off my medication years ago that I have less of a filter. She switched the lock around the correct way, and I blurted out without thinking, ""Oh, nice job. Your IQ just went up 10 points.""

I didn't mean it to be hurtful, and my supervisor is someone that I greatly respect and don't think poorly of at all. I just don't goddamn think, and I'm way too interested in being liked and funny. I actually meant it to come out of my head like, ""Oh, XXX, you're already smarter than me and now your IQ went up even higher!"" But that's what came out. I swear. I just don't goddamn think. Her and another coworker acknowledged it and moved on. I was so embarrassed with myself, I just froze and let the moment pass.

I then, before closing last week, told a travel story that was slightly racially tinged. Didn't even consider it to be a problem. Because someone asked about my experiences in Canada. The story revolved around a waitress I met just below the Alaskan border. When asked if there was anything interesting in town, she responded that there was a Spanish festival in town with ""real Mexicans"". I live and work in Southern California. I stressed when I told the story that it was odd just because of meeting said racist person. Well, apparently someone complained. I'm not sure what the complaint was, but they did. I suppose I shouldn't have told a racial story at all. That was so incredibly stupid of me.

On top of that, this same supervisor misconstrued a comment I made last week to another coworker of being unsupportive of her potential promotion, which I had no response to. I remember the comment, and it was completely the opposite. Not only do I want her to get the promotion, I've told her as much many times before. I genuinely do. So, I'm not really sure what I did there other than make my manager doubt my sincerity to such a point.

Basically, I've shoved my foot into my mouth 3 times within a week at my workplace. This manager now understandably doesn't like me. She was noticeably different in demeanor and politely short the entire time. I apologized profusely and told her I never meant to insult anyone, including her. I asked if there was anything for follow up, and she said there wasn't. Just that she'd be sending me an email to confirm we talked. And, that I want to keep it.

I won't be getting letters of recommendation after this, so I'm not sure what point there is in continuing to work there. And I've never wanted to offend anyone. And I've become the world's biggest screwup.

Please, don't just call me an idiot. Because, I know that already.","I made incredibly stupid jokes/comments at work, trying to be funny to get people to like me. Now someone complained. How do I continue going forward?",t52n11,LifeAdvice,nopointinlife1234,1,1.0,0,1,/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t52n11/i_made_incredibly_stupid_jokescomments_at_work/,1646235070,1,2022-03-02 18:31:10-05:00,2022-03-02,18:31:10,3,2,18,"I made incredibly stupid jokes/comments at work, trying to be funny to get people to like me. Now someone complained. How do I continue going forward? First off, I know that obviously since someone is offended, I need to stop making jokes. I understand that. And I'm more than willing. I never meant to offend anyone.

I'm a white male, but I never in my dreams would want to offend anyone. I work at a public library, and I've put my foot in my mouth three times in last week. I've been there about 8 months now without incident.

The first time, my supervisor was messing with a lock. I was ADD growing up, medicated, and I found that ever since I went off my medication years ago that I have less of a filter. She switched the lock around the correct way, and I blurted out without thinking, ""Oh, nice job. Your IQ just went up 10 points.""

I didn't mean it to be hurtful, and my supervisor is someone that I greatly respect and don't think poorly of at all. I just don't goddamn think, and I'm way too interested in being liked and funny. I actually meant it to come out of my head like, ""Oh, XXX, you're already smarter than me and now your IQ went up even higher!"" But that's what came out. I swear. I just don't goddamn think. Her and another coworker acknowledged it and moved on. I was so embarrassed with myself, I just froze and let the moment pass.

I then, before closing last week, told a travel story that was slightly racially tinged. Didn't even consider it to be a problem. Because someone asked about my experiences in Canada. The story revolved around a waitress I met just below the Alaskan border. When asked if there was anything interesting in town, she responded that there was a Spanish festival in town with ""real Mexicans"". I live and work in Southern California. I stressed when I told the story that it was odd just because of meeting said racist person. Well, apparently someone complained. I'm not sure what the complaint was, but they did. I suppose I shouldn't have told a racial story at all. That was so incredibly stupid of me.

On top of that, this same supervisor misconstrued a comment I made last week to another coworker of being unsupportive of her potential promotion, which I had no response to. I remember the comment, and it was completely the opposite. Not only do I want her to get the promotion, I've told her as much many times before. I genuinely do. So, I'm not really sure what I did there other than make my manager doubt my sincerity to such a point.

Basically, I've shoved my foot into my mouth 3 times within a week at my workplace. This manager now understandably doesn't like me. She was noticeably different in demeanor and politely short the entire time. I apologized profusely and told her I never meant to insult anyone, including her. I asked if there was anything for follow up, and she said there wasn't. Just that she'd be sending me an email to confirm we talked. And, that I want to keep it. I'm unsure if that means HR isn't involved? I have no idea. She basically just stressed that I need to stop joking, and that some people that ""don't know me"" may take things offensively.

"Just for a bit of background, the past two years-ish have been really shit and mentally difficult for me and I’m so confused about life right now that I’m having literal decision paralysis. 

I graduated from university in 2019 and moved away from London and back in with my parents, got a retail job for a while just to save up some money and then the pandemic happened. Im in my mid 20s right now. A few months into the first lockdown, when I realised that I probably would have to put my career goals on pause for a bit because I graduated with a media related degree, I developed a health condition related to my eyes which has made using screens and doing close-up work very, very difficult and I’ve had it for almost 2 years now. On top of that, there are massive problems with my parents’ marriage and I have been amongst abuse for the time I’ve been living here (and for my whole childhood but that’s a different story). 

Because of my health problem I felt like there was just no way for me to get a job that I could actually live off of and move out so I’ve just been putting up with the home situation. It has caused me severe stress and anxiety which I think is really affecting my physical health too now. I’ve ended up in a weird cycle where I feel very very unmotivated and anxious and every single thing is causing me anxiety. I also don’t have that many friends that I can depend on so I just don’t really have anyone to ask for serious advice I can trust. 

I really want to move back to London and actually have my own life and meet people and date and do normal things someone my age should do. I feel I’m in a position now to be able to do jobs that don’t require much concentration or close up work, so I’ve started looking for rooms to rent first because I would like to get out of my situation as soon as possible and then hopefully find a job fairly quickly after moving out. I have a bit of money saved up. However I know it would be better to find a job first and then move out once I’ve secured it, but doing both at the same time is too much both for my eye problem and also mentally so I’ve decided to find accommodation first. 

I feel that I’m making a really big mistake. I’ve stopped being able to trust my intuition because of the stress I’ve been under so every single thing seems pointless and hopeless and everything seems bleak. I love London and I want to live in a big city but I’m really anxious about moving out and living with other people and having to deal with shitty accommodation and I’m worried I won’t get a job but I also feel under pressure because living where I’m living right now is causing my mental and physical health to suffer. I don’t have family in this country and I don’t have any friends to stay with for a while so I just feel so stuck. Is it a bad idea to move out first and then find a job afterwards? Am I being stupid? My parents think I’m making a mistake. 

I could use my savings for something different like moving to a different country or going travelling (although I would prefer to do that after the pandemic has fully resolved) but I wanted to move back to London from the moment I moved away and I just want to start being being financially independent instead of travelling. I feel very confused and alone and I can’t trust myself. If anyone actually reads this whole thing, thank you.

"In 5 months, I am planning to move out of my state to Iowa to be with my adoptive mother. I'm currently employed full time, a contractual employee to clarify to a high school as a janitor. The contract will run out by July 7th, as it was the official time in which I was hired on.

I have a vehicle that I've been co-leased into thanks to my asshole father whom I'm moving out from for the third time in my life. First time I moved from him was when I was 23, second time was when I was 28 and this time is when I'm 32. I just can't deal with him anymore with his oppressing list of issues with him that just stagnates my life.

Here's how my plan is going to go;

I'm going to stay with this job for 5 months, to fulfill my contractual obligations. I've got to save up at least $8,000 by then because the apartment I'm picking is $650 a month and I hope to get 5 months in by which should be enough time to quickly find a job in Iowa to keep the payments up.

As for my vehicle's lease agreement, it's on 48 months, 10,000 mile annual limit, $21,236.64 total payments broken down to $442.43 a month. My dad's the one paying for my insurance while I have to handle the car payment and he had to co-sign the lease for the vehicle to get me on board.

I plan to take this vehicle with me on my trip to Iowa. I want to rely no more on buses like Greyhound or take chances with even an airplane trip.

"Okay so I've (20F) just recently gotten into a new relationship that I'm really happy in. It's my second relationship and I feel better in this one than I did in my last. ANYWAY to the point.

I've done one previous work experience job when I was 16 and my first proper paying job that I only stayed in for 3 weeks was my first paying job that I had last year.

What I'm stressing over is how on earth do people balance having a relationship, having a job and studying for uni all in one???? Because I really want to go to uni for Veterinary Nursing and that will obviously have a shit load of studying involved.

"The word “best” is totally subjective here, I just used it for the title. What I mean is, How do you ‘figure out’ what you personally would feel is the most well-suited ending for your story?   

Some writers like an ending where everyone ends up happy. Some people kill a character off at the end and the rest of the characters are fine but in mourning. Some writers stop and never finish because they don’t know how to end it.     

My problem is I know where I want my characters to start, what direction they will develop, but I’m not sure where they should land. Questions that go through my head are, What would feel the most rewarding to read/to write? What ending would feel the most natural according to the progression? Keeping in mind as well, that a story arguably doesn’t just have *one* ending, but multiple *endings* for each individual character based on their own journey.

"I have written a fanfic set in an au where the characters in the fandom (Hilda) are already adults and I added an arc where two of the characters (Frida and Trevor) relapsed into their old habit which is smoking, after a setback and the way I wrote it, I listed some of the effects of smoking on both the person and those around them.

I am a non-smoker and I strongly condemn smoking, but also believe that people can break the habit with support from friends and family.

As a result, I got this comment.

From what i understand: She is ashemed becouse she promisted herself to quiet but has fallen again becouse of stress. Ok, but from how the characters act and some writing choizes you seem to villainize smoking it self. Did you really thought that it was necesary to put a huge warning last chapter about ""Tabacco use"" or "" some people may find disturbing""? Imagine if other stories did that.

"i've been working in retail for the past year, and after switching jobs a lot i finally found a decent-paying job at a grocery store in my area.

i really cannot stand working in retail anymore, though. i'm very socially awkward, so i'm not good at dealing with people at all or making friendly conversation with any of my co-workers no matter how much i try. i also get overwhelmed incredibly easily, so just standing there for even an hour quickly puts me in a bad mood and makes me more depressed and emotionally drained. and to add even more insult to injury, most of my favorite co-workers are leaving soon within the span of a few months, so i'll have almost nobody to turn to when things get hard anymore.

i love the people i work with. they're all very nice and cool and fun to talk to, but... they don't make work better for me unfortunately, and i don't think anything will. it also doesn't help that they've been giving me way more hours, like, more than i can handle. i could change my availability, but there could be repercussions that come with that. one of my biggest issues too is that i don't have my license yet, so it's not like i can just go out and find a job elsewhere that isn't in a retail environment, so i'm kinda stuck until i pass my driver's test (if i do).

i love the people i work with. they're all very nice and cool and fun to talk to, but... they don't make work better for me unfortunately, and i don't think anything will. it also doesn't help that they've been giving me way more hours, like, more than i can handle. i could change my availability, but there could be repercussions that come with that. one of my biggest issues too is that i don't have my license yet, so it's not like i can just go out and find a job elsewhere that isn't in a retail environment, so i'm kinda stuck until i pass my driver's test (if i do).

"Well I want to try to keep this post short, so I won't really go into great detail. So I finally found the confidence I've been looking for my whole life at 28 years old, but it came at the expense of a bad relationship (it was my 1st) and I was terrible without going into full detail about the relationship, I was insecure, kinda immature about some things, kept comparing myself to other dudes etc., only to come to the realization that all I had to do was stay focused on myself and she would of been along with the program. We broke up once and go back together, and things didn't get any better and it ended up being a whole 2 years of wasted time and that's the 1 thing that eat at me (mainly because I feel like did most of the wasting), but I try not to dwell. Since day 1 she was waiting on me to become the man I needed to be, she even told me I would be every woman dream if had it at least 70% together (which not literally but I get the point). Im fully over that person now, been single for some months and moved on but I made this post mainly about my confidence. I'm happier, about to get in the best shape of my life, working 2 full time jobs and a side hustle but my question is why did it have to come this way, especially at someone else's expense? I guess it's called life but damn talk about embarrassing 🤦🏾‍♂️. 

Also I dealt with a great deal of trauma from my childhood past from being a sheltered kid that I didn't realize and even though I had both parents in the home they were mentally ill because their traumas that they still to this day never realized ( they meant well, just a lot things they didn't know), and I finally found out all of my ""why me"" questions. And I did it all without a therapist. Because of this though, I used to want a family and marriage but now I'm considering not even having kids nor marriage at all because I'm just afraid any kid I would have I missed out on so much in the past and I want a mature fun and lit life. I'm even considering getting a vasectomy. 

I'm solely focused on myself right now becoming the great man I know I'm potentially capable of being. I don't have it all figured out just yet, I'll just leave it up to God, but I'm noticeably better than I've ever been my entire life and it's refreshing even though I'm still a working progress.

"Hi everyone!
So I've been in a relationship with the most amazing person for over a year now and I love her to bits and would do pretty much anything for her.
She struggles with pretty severe anxiety/depressive phases as well as having no plans whatsoever for her future. She hates her course but cannot monetarily afford to change it and therapy/councelling are very slow to get as she cannot afford a private therapist.
Whenever she talks to me about these problems I feel incredibly helpless, I've tried everything in my power to help amd it has had minor successes but she still struggles a lot every day.
I am by no means perfect, and I have been working on my flaws (especially my forgetfulness) but I just don't know how to further help her, but it is all I want.
I have a very specific view of life and how I'd like to live it but I am very aware that that does not apply to everyone, and many times when I try to show her how I cope with things she just doesn't understand.
I also don't want to risk making anything worse which is why I try not to advise her to make big changes in life, because I don't know how it will affect her as it might make the whole situation worse.

"Hi Everyone

I've never really done this before but I'm so conflicted and have been for so long I would just like some answers. Just to be clear I am certain of my sexual orientation (Hetro), this question is more about sexuality itself.

I come from a religious background (though I no longer practise), and I was also homeschooled with online learning from the age of 12 onwards, I mention these factors as I feel they likely bear some relevance in my problem.

I am and always have been ashamed of my sexuality, that is to say I have a very high drive and had fantasies from quite a young age (10), though I never had anyone to talk to this about due to other factors (such as high functioning aspergers) I never really understood or got on well with my peers as a child/teenager and never recieved any form of Sex Education.

When I asked my parents about masturbation there answers were quite vague and unhelpful and being caught on two occasions led me to strongly associate it with shame. I also began to watch porn at around this age (very young I know) and when my sister found my diary where I had written about it she told me I wasn't the person she thought I was and that was one of the most hurtful things I have ever heard.

My relationship with porn became problematic (or at least I read about No Fap and began to percieve my habbit had become an addiction, though whether this was reality or psychosematic I couldn't tell you), and so when I started my current relationship I determined to give it, and masturbation up for good.

That obviously didn't stick (our sex life is not particuarly active or reliable) and every time I masturbated or watched porn my girlfriend was very hurt and felt it was cheating which further added to my guilt and shame.

With all that background out of the way I would like answers to the following questions, if in your combined wisdom you have any.

Is it a sin, or morally wrong, or socially unacceptable to masturbate?

Is it a sin, or morally wrong, or socially unacceptable to have sexual fantasies?

Is it cheating to have sexual experiences solo when you are in a relationship?

Is it a sin, or morally wrong, or socially unacceptable to enjoy pornography and does it make you a bad person or a sexist or a misogynist?

And finally...

Do you have any advice on how to grow more comfortable embracing and exploring your sexuality without shame or guilt?

With all that background out of the way I would like answers to the following questions, if in your combined wisdom you have any.

Is it a sin, or morally wrong, or socially unacceptable to masturbate?

Is it a sin, or morally wrong, or socially unacceptable to have sexual fantasies?

Is it cheating to have sexual experiences solo when you are in a relationship?

Is it a sin, or morally wrong, or socially unacceptable to enjoy pornography and does it make you a bad person or a sexist or a misogynist?

And finally...

Do you have any advice on how to grow more comfortable embracing and exploring your sexuality without shame or guilt?

"Hello, I'm a 23 year old male Computer Science major. Recently I've been struggling with planning for my future and feel like I've dug myself into a pit.

As graduation inches closer, I've realized that I don't actually want a job with my chosen major. 

I've expressed this to friends and family and so far everyone has given me the same advice: finish the degree and get a job do you can have a house and a family one day.

Although this is my junior year, I still have around 3 years to finish my bachelor's degree because I've been taking less classes and paying my way through via a part time retail job.

Thus far I've been able to avoid student loans entirely. However, as I've slowly been taking less classes every semester I've realized that what I'm doing is really a stalling tactic because graduating means getting a real job.

I chose Computer Science because the minimal programming I had done before college was fun and everything I've learned so far I've enjoyed but I simply cannot imagine myself working a 9-5 from home or an office, as a part of someone else's business selling a product, maintaining a website/service, etc...

In addition, every two weeks for the past two years whenever I've had a homework project for computer science I've consistently spent an entire day on my bed in tears in the fetal position, racked with a mixture of anxiety and depression. 

Only work for my computer science classes triggers this. It's gotten to the point where I have to plan ahead on having a ""freak out day"" before I actually want to get started on programming. I fear that nothing would change if I got a job with my degree because then my livelyhood is at stake and not just a letter grade.

I've let others know about this, and they recommend that I sign up for the campus therapy for students. I agree, but the instant I get the project done and turned in therapy makes as much sense as filling a bath with cheese wiz and jumping in.

I feel absolutely fine otherwise, my anxiety episodes are only triggered by performing anything programming-related.

Even though I'm done with GE's as of this semester, I'm not even in the ""professional"" program yet. Some I've talked to, including my parents, reccomend quitting my job and taking out loans to finish school as fast as possible so I can start making an ""adult"" salary.

They are insistent about this no matter how many times I explain thinking about having a programming job makes me sick to my stomach.

I feel like I have no choice but to keep going. It's the smart thing to do.

My heart however, tells me to follow what I want to do regardless of money.

If it were completely up to me, I would like to try being a vtuber and streaming. I know it's a pipe dream and many people try but select few succeed but I don't want to give up on a dream I haven't tried. I'm not in it for fame or fortune either, I genuinely enjoy making other people happy and producing online content is probably the easiest method to do so.

There's also the joke of becoming a furry artist, except for me it's a possible reality.

I've been running a NSFW Deviantart page off and on since last summer and have over 1000 watchers, I could definitely start making money off it If I wanted to. Not exactly rent money, but income nonetheless.

"Just for a bit of background, the past two years-ish have been really shit and mentally difficult for me and I’m so confused about life right now that I’m having literal decision paralysis. 

I graduated from university in 2019 and moved away from London and back in with my parents, got a retail job for a while just to save up some money and then the pandemic happened. Im in my mid 20s right now. A few months into the first lockdown, when I realised that I probably would have to put my career goals on pause for a bit because I graduated with a media related degree, I developed a health condition related to my eyes which has made using screens and doing close-up work very, very difficult and I’ve had it for almost 2 years now. On top of that, there are massive problems with my parents’ marriage and I have been amongst abuse for the time I’ve been living here (and for my whole childhood but that’s a different story). 

Because of my health problem I felt like there was just no way for me to get a job that I could actually live off of and move out so I’ve just been putting up with the home situation. It has caused me severe stress and anxiety which I think is really affecting my physical health too now. I’ve ended up in a weird cycle where I feel very very unmotivated and anxious and every single thing is causing me anxiety. I also don’t have that many friends that I can depend on so I just don’t really have anyone to ask for serious advice I can trust. 

I really want to move back to London and actually have my own life and meet people and date and do normal things someone my age should do. I feel I’m in a position now to be able to do jobs that don’t require much concentration or close up work, so I’ve started looking for rooms to rent first because I would like to get out of my situation as soon as possible and then hopefully find a job fairly quickly after moving out. I have a bit of money saved up. However I know it would be better to find a job first and then move out once I’ve secured it, but doing both at the same time is too much both for my eye problem and also mentally so I’ve decided to find accommodation first. 

I feel that I’m making a really big mistake. I’ve stopped being able to trust my intuition because of the stress I’ve been under so every single thing seems pointless and hopeless and everything seems bleak. I love London and I want to live in a big city but I’m really anxious about moving out and living with other people and having to deal with shitty accommodation and I’m worried I won’t get a job but I also feel under pressure because living where I’m living right now is causing my mental and physical health to suffer. I don’t have family in this country and I don’t have any friends to stay with for a while so I just feel so stuck. Is it a bad idea to move out first and then find a job afterwards? Am I being stupid? My parents think I’m making a mistake. 

I could use my savings for something different like moving to a different country or going travelling (although I would prefer to do that after the pandemic has fully resolved) but I wanted to move back to London from the moment I moved away and I just want to start being being financially independent instead of travelling. I feel very confused and alone and I can’t trust myself. If anyone actually reads this whole thing, thank you.

"For a while now, I've been finding myself up till 2 or 3 or sometimes 4 in the morning with my phone in bed, because it's the one time of the day that I get the most possible words written down.

"I was going to post this on r/writing but this seems a lot more relevant to fanfiction specifically. I'm just kinda baffled at why tho??
I read fanfiction from time to time and I see (for example), this: ""the silver haired man (insert verb here)"" a lot for some reason. This sort of ambiguous description makes sense in small doses or when a character is still mysterious and unknown, but using surface level descriptions instead of a character's name is weird to me.
This being so common in fanfiction also makes me confused because if I am reading fanwork about a series I am familiar with, wouldn't I already know what a character's hair/eyes/age is like? I read a fic just now that was perfectly eloquent otherwise but they put ""the older male"" instead of ""Kakashi"" out of nowhere like the fact he was older and a ""male"" was significant in this situation. Sometimes it feels like the author is purposefully trying to use the character's actual name as little as they possibly can and for what? 
I simply do not know. I'm not sure if this bothers others the way it does me though.

We're very happy to say that we are starting to bring on a bunch of new moderators! The sub has grown at a rapid pace over the last two years, and so has the need for a larger mod team.

Hullo! I'm Blu, I've been part of the sub for a couple of years and I'm delighted to join as a mod. I've been reading fanfiction for the past six years, and writing it for the past five. I jump between fandoms a lot, but my current obsessions are Marvel, My Hero Academia, and Harry Potter. I also really like analysis and meta, so feel free to ramble to me about headcanons and theories! World-building is my lifeblood.

Hi all! You can call me Froze. I've been a part of the sub for just coming up on a year now, and weaving in and out of the fanfic world since way back in the halcyon days of LiveJournal.

"* I'm in my mid 30s
* I'm a high school dropout
* I have my GED
* I'm on disability
* I've been programming on and off for over 20 years - personal projects and for fun, with some side work before I got on disability. Nothing consistent or sustainable enough to live off of (Because of my disability), but enough to not completely live off my parents.
* I live in a smaller town (10-25k people) with a college, and two more colleges within 40 minutes.
* I have my own car

I just wanted to say all that so you have a good idea of where I'm coming from.

Anyways on to the life advice part.

I want to get a degree in something so I can find a decent paying job and contribute to society. I can't work somewhere that doesn't have good insurance due to my disability, so a degree may be required.

My local college doesn't have a computer science program, but they do have a business program (Something I'm somewhat passionate about). The two colleges near by have computer science programs, but my anxiety affects my driving. I can do it, but it's a little difficult.

What I want to know is the following

1. Is it worth taking general ed courses in my local college, math courses, and whatever else that would go towards a computer science degree (??) and transfer to one of the other colleges near here? Or should I just bite the bullet and go to one with a computer science program right away even though I have no college credits
2. Should I try to get various certifications that are compsci related (A+, Networking, etc.) and try to find a job that way? I know my way around hardware, but it's not really my passion.

I'm at a loss as to what to do. I'm tired of being on disability, but I literally can not survive without the insurance it provides. I've made some progress since I was approved on the main things affecting my working ability, but I'm still not quite there yet either - so this is going to be a several year process no matter what I choose to do.","[USA] I'm in my 30s, a high school dropout (GED) on disability, but I've been programming for 20+ years.

"hello everyone! i hope you're all doing good ❤

tldr: should i go abroad and leave my bf and my cat? 

so i have an opportunity to go abroad within this year. it's for work, but if i  would be able to save up some money, i might also get to study. or, i may also be able to move to another country, to fulfill my dream of travelling to different countries around the world.
i really want to do something in my life that i would be proud of someday. ever since i was younger, i've been wanting to take the risk and just go abroad and live the nomad life alone.
all my friends are in college, and i'm so sick and tired of being jealous that we can't afford it, and i'm sick and tired of my family &amp; relatives  comparing me to other people my age, or them waiting for me to do something that lives up to the potential they thought i have, and then obviously getting disappointed. damn, i am so sick and tired of getting disappointed at myself.
my life has just been a series of disappointment since high school, and so as time goes by, i am slowly hiding and isolating myself. i am ashamed  because my cousins/friends/schoolmates, are all doing well in their jobs and universities, whereas i am stuck at home, with no job + not in college + depression. 
but anyway, i do have an opportunity now to redeem myself and escape this series of disappointments. and it's what i've been wanting to do ever since!

BUT... that means i would have to leave my boyfriend and my cat.

first, my boyfriend. he's been my best-est friend during all of this hard times, he supported me through all my ups and downs, and he's been the person that i've always leaned on to. and heck, i'd marry him any day.
but he can't come because he's still in college. and i'm afraid that we might break up because if i'm being honest, i might never go back. 

second, my cat. please don't think this is petty, my cat is so important to me. he is my best friend too. i took care of him since he was born and he's never known a life without me being there for him every minute of every day. wherever i go, he goes too. he sleeps beside me, sits on my lap everyday, looks for me when i'm not in sight, wants me to carry him all the time, and licks my tears when i cry. he can even make me laugh with his silly antics. he's so so clingy and he would make loud noises when he can't see me. he is kinda aggressive to everybody else, and doesn't even want my mom to carry him.

i'm having a hard time deciding if i would go, especially because of my cat. i don't know where he should stay once i'm gone, and i know he would be so stressed looking for me. 
but i also know that a cat's life is very short compared to humans and i can't base my decisions, that would impact my whole life, on him.

he's sleeping on my lap right now as i'm writing this. and looking at him right now, i just want to cuddle with him and stay with him forever.

but time goes on, and i am only growing older. and i haven't done anything with my life. i'm terrified of being old and dissatisfied doing nothing with my life. even if i put this ""going abroad"" off for a year, my bf and my cat would still be there making it hard for me to go.

if i stay here, i wouldn't ever afford to go to college. i would always only be qualified for low wage jobs, and living a life of poverty like the rest of my family is definitely not a dream of mine. 

what do you think should i do?

i'm having a hard time deciding if i would go, especially because of my cat. i don't know where he should stay once i'm gone, and i know he would be so stressed looking for me. 
but i also know that a cat's life is very short compared to humans and i can't base my decisions, that would impact my whole life, on him.

he's sleeping on my lap right now as i'm writing this. and looking at him right now, i just want to cuddle with him and stay with him forever.

but time goes on, and i am only growing older. and i haven't done anything with my life. i'm terrified of being old and dissatisfied doing nothing with my life. even if i put this ""going abroad"" off for a year, my bf and my cat would still be there making it hard for me to go.

if i stay here, i wouldn't ever afford to go to college. i would always only be qualified for low wage jobs, and living a life of poverty like the rest of my family is definitely not a dream of mine. 

what do you think should i do?

"If you've been on this subreddit for longer than, say, three days or so, you probably notice a lot of repetitive or redundant questions. Things like:

  - Is this a good amount of kudos? (The answer is almost always ""yes"" or ""it depends"".)
  - What does ""AO3"" stand for? (It baffles me that this is even asked at all.)
  - What are some tips for starting a fanfic?

I've seen some other subreddits that post a ""Weekly Small Questions Thread"", where common questions can be grouped together in a single recurring thread that's pinned to the top of the feed and given a noticeable title.

Lots of questions are answered here on a daily basis, but none of the answers stick around long enough for other users to find them. They could search (and I certainly wish they would), yes, but Reddit's search function is notorious for being worse than useless sometimes.

It's quite a bit of effort to maintain a FAQ, so I figure an automoderator post once a week is less difficult. Some onus would be placed on the moderators, in the form of directing traffic (closing questions not worth their own thread and pointing the users toward the WSQT), but then once the userbase of this sub is accustomed to such a thread, the work of moderation may actually become easier as a consequence of consolidation.

And judging by some of the responses in [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/t7yknj/whats_up_with_the_downvoting_people_for_asking/), doing so may be able to help curtail the recent downvoting epidemic.",Proposal: Weekly Small Questions Thread,t83v6d,FanFiction,ALapsedPacifist,1,1.0,0,0,/r/FanFiction/comments/t83v6d/proposal_weekly_small_questions_thread/,1646588252,0,2022-03-06 20:37:32-05:00,2022-03-06,20:37:32,3,6,20,"Proposal: Weekly Small Questions Thread If you've been on this subreddit for longer than, say, three days or so, you probably notice a lot of repetitive or redundant questions.

"So I’m turning 30 in April. I’ve been working my entire life. All my friends wanted to do growing up was smoke weed and drink. I actually left my home province 4+ years ago just to get out of it.

I have money now and an amazing job… on the other side of the continent. No family or friends or fun to be seen. Work, gym, then sleep enough to work and gym. Trying snowboarding but it’s still not scratching the itch. 

I have no idea what to do, I feel like I’m missing out on life but I can’t just not have income then work until I’m fucking 70. I’ll kill myself if I’m still working at 50… even 40. I fucking hate work. It’s so… redundant. 

Considered quitting life and travelling, maybe do a working holiday in Australia. But I’d be doing all this shit by myself and I’m sick of being alone. It’s been years of it.

I’m just watching time pass making the best of my situation. I know I’m lucky I’m comparison to a lot of people. My best friend is doing his third stint in rehab next month.

Hi everyone. This is going to sound stupid to a lot of you and I understand that, so if you could do your best to avoid being rude and such, I would appreciate it. So I'll get started.

I'm 14 in 8th grade, and I have some friends who are starting to loose their virginity and who are also getting/giving things like bj's, fingering etc. I'm aware all of this is happening pretty early for my age (i think at least) and I'm overwhelmed by it to be honest. I've done some things before, but none that required me to show my dick lol. I have plans on doing stuff with someone possibly and I just dont know where to go for advice so what better place then here I guess. im just really nervous and dont want to make it bad sex for both of us, and id prefer we both come out of it satisfied if possible. anyone have any tips?

"So if you could recommend some good stories to read I would really greatful. I read and write and many fandoms, and generally I'm not picky. As a general rule I just want a good story with actual plot and character divelopment. I love time travel stories, and alternate universes, but those two are just ideas, in all seriusness almost anything is fine with me, if the stories is good. If it comes to romance I don't really care who's end up with who - of course I have my preferences, witch are different fandom to fandom, but as long as it's well-written and consentsual... just suprise me. I love long stories, as well. I have some examples for fandoms, but I'm always open to anything new as well.  So same examples...

If it's a **HP** fic almost anything goes with me. Plus points for your house if it focuses a bit on the friendship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, if Ron isn't stupid, and Hermione isn't perfect. I'm fourever on the hunt for interesting Slytherin centric fanfic, where they aren't one dimentional bad guys, but kids with their own personalities, in the middle of war. I also love the Maraduers, although Snape/Lily is a no for me, so is the Snape/Maraduers parings. 

If it's **SPN,** please give me something with a good case, and with with strong, helathy brotherly connection between Sam and Dean. I started the show for Sam and Dean, so I would stick with them.  I love family (blood family and choosen family) centric stories. I don't hate John or Mary, at so their timline could work as well. I love Bobby, Ellen and Jo, Jody,  they are more the boys family for me than anybody else. I love Cas as a character, but it's obvius, so maybe don't even need to be said. Again, I don't really care about ships, anything could work but pie for you as a reward if you could find something with unusal parings. I don't care if it's het or not, just give me something good. I'm a bit bord of the usual Dean/Cas and Sam/Eileen situation. 

If it's **Charmed** pls only recommend from OG. I tried with the reboot but it's not my cup of tea. I would love something wich takes places in Chris's dark future, and the more detailed the better. Angel wings for you if you have Phoebe and Cole in an interesting yet helathy relationship, but that's just a plus. I would also be happy with a story witch feacures all four sisters because I never read one of those before. 

If it's **NBC's Hannibal,** you will get an invitation for Dinner if your story have your own version of Clarice because I'm so sad this Hannibal never got his Clarice. Also plus points for Ardelia, because writers always forget about her, yet I love the strong friendship between Starling and Mapp. 

I'm also a **DC and Marvel** fan. (Yes, both.) If you have something with Arrow, pls, just please give me a break and drop something witch don't include Felicity. 

I love **Prodigal Son**, and if you have something in that fandom I would prefer a strange yet strong father son relationship between Martin and Malcolm, and a good case. 

Crossover fics are also fine with me. I think I rerly read good fics in the **Gilmore Girls** fandom, so if you have one of those, than coffee is on me at Luke's. If you have one in wich Dean Forester isn't the devil himself, add burgers too, because that boy as the bad guy is sooo boring I can't even tell you.

I'm also a **DC and Marvel** fan. (Yes, both.) If you have something with Arrow, pls, just please give me a break and drop something witch don't include Felicity. 

I love **Prodigal Son**, and if you have something in that fandom I would prefer a strange yet strong father son relationship between Martin and Malcolm, and a good case. 

Crossover fics are also fine with me. I think I rerly read good fics in the **Gilmore Girls** fandom, so if you have one of those, than coffee is on me at Luke's. If you have one in wich Dean Forester isn't the devil himself, add burgers too, because that boy as the bad guy is sooo boring I can't even tell you.

"I'm in my 30s, started working a year ago (like a legit clock in/clock out job). At home, I have my son (16).

Outside of the house, I have my niece (12) who lives 30 minutes away.

I work 40+ hrs a week. Physically demanding, between 8-12 hr days. Mainly monday through Friday, sometimes Saturday. My hours vary between 10am to 2am (normally 10am-10pm). 

Once the weekend hits, I'm exhausted but I still have my own household to handle (my laundry, dinner plans, cleaning up, etc). I'm also the one who drives my sons grandma around on Saturday. Sometimes, it's to the tobacco store and she'll grab herself a lunch. Other times, it'll be a 5 hr grocery trip. This Saturday, she has an appt at the hospital that I'm taking her to, and I gotta stay there. 

My niece has been through hell and she struggles with depression, suicidal tendencies, etc... so I try to make time for her... but her guardian also has her enrolled in other things that take up her weekends (which is amazing, I love it and fully support it 100%). This past weekend, my niece was being rude and I finally ""snapped"". Shes been rude towards me everytime I've seen her (try to make it every weekend)... and honestly, I question why I should have to deal with the disrespect when I can organize and clean my house that I've been neglecting, ya know.. spend time with my own child. She said I haven't been there for her lately ""with everything going on"" (again been through hell in her past, bullies at school currently, things like that). 

So how am I supposed to divide my time? Last Saturday morning, I went through my patio and the storage section of the apartment, then skipped my time with my son to go hang out with my niece at her house. Sunday, she was busy with her stuff but I had to take care of grandma and my brother had a mental health crisis (that really lasted from Saturday night until sunday late evening). My son worked all sunday so I only seen him that night. I also do most of my dog training during the weekend.

I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders... and I can't neglect anyone bc how dare I do that?... but sometimes, I feel like I'm pouring from an empty bucket. I have nothing left to give!... but again, I feel like their needs are their needs and I have to attend to them. My wants of whatever doesnt matter bc honestly, idk what I even want.

"I made a post on r/advice recently about me sometimes feeling angry and resentful when I see other guys succeeding with women then the people on the post started bashing me and saying I have a shit personality and bad attitude and it’s no wonder no woman ever wanted me. 

I sometimes get angry because I’ve always failed at dating and never had a single girlfriend in my life even though I’ve tried hard so seeing other guys succeed at it makes me feel bad about myself. I think there may have been some misconceptions on my original post. 

First of all I NEVER do anything to those couples that make me feel bad. I have nothing against *THEM*. My frustration is at *MYSELF* and my life. I think this is the main thing people misunderstood. Secondly when I do feel angry I keep it to myself. I never act on it and never do anything to anyone. It’s as simple as me seeing a guy succeeding with women and then me going home and feeling bad about it. I never hurt anyone.

All these feelings I keep to myself. Now just for this people started bullying me and saying I have a shit personality, bad attitude and it’s no wonder no woman ever wanted me.

"Ive been struggling with alot in my life recently, I’m 20 years old, and my mother thinks I need a curfew of 10 on weekdays and 12 on weekends, constantly asks where and what I’m doing, and doesn’t allow me to stay with my girlfriends family overnight.

"My wife and I have had a roommate for about 3 years now. 

At the end of year 1 l, we experienced a house fire, to which we lost all physical possessions minus a vehicle. At the beginning of year 2, my family had received a very generous sum of money from anonymous donors to help us rebuild our lives. 

I am compassionate and sometimes overly generous, very few had donated to our roommate after this incident and I felt that as their roommate/friend that I should help replace a few (unnecessary at the time) items of decent monetarily value. I purchased 65"" TV, glass top TV stand, newest Xbox, and game as a gift for them, I still hold the original receipt physically and digitally, almost totalling $1,200.

Fast forward to the beginning of Dec. '21..

Early in December I lost my grandfather, who had raised me like one of his sons from the age 18mo. old, leaving his wife alone. I felt obligated to try and move closer to home so that I could help her with a 20 acre farm and bills. I sat my roommate down shortly after receiving the news and talked about moving around income tax time in '22. We only talked and set no dates except for 'tax time', which as many of you know can take months. 

Fast forward to the middle of January..

My roommate moved out without a notice of any kind. They were gone for two weeks, said nothing about coming back or leaving. When I had asked them if they were going to help pay for rent, I was immediately told that they had already moved out. Leaving 98% possessions in the room they were staying.. I was given no date of when they would come to pick stuff up or clean, only ""I'll be there's"" and not showing up without saying anything.

It's been over 30 days and there's still 60% (my gifts among them, minus the Xbox and game) of their items still in the room, having made one trip only for clothes within the last week. 

I took the liberty of bagging and boxing everything up since I'm the head of the lease. 
I've received no form of payment for 'storage use' of the room and feel that I should keep the remaining gift items I physically purchased as reimbursement for the storage and damages to the walls and carpeting. 
But at the same time they're my friend and I don't want to be that way. 
But at the same time, my family and I feel wronged. I have 3 kids sleeping in one room with 3 beds, I could really use that space and they're robbing me of space and time. 

He even had a car for 2 years with no tags and no license that just got towed away, it seems as if he doesn't care what he loses.

"I've been writing my entire life, from my own stories when I was in elementary school to fanfiction in high school. I started reading and writing fanfiction about 10 years ago, first on quotev, then on tumblr, and finally on ao3 in 2015. I posted about 10 fics in the span of a year, ranging from about 1k words to 19k words. 

I fell out of love with the fandom that I was posting in, and my last fic was unfortunately left unfinished in 2017, and I have no plans on ever continuing it. My life moved on, and while I never stopped reading fanfiction, I completely stopped writing it. I would think about writing all the time, small scenes and short plot points would inevitably end up in my brain, but I haven't actually written anything since then.

Last month, I got really weirdly inspired. I planned out the basic plotline of a fic, and then began seriously writing for the first time in 5 years. I thought I would struggle, wouldn't be able to write very much and give up, but my goal was to get 15k words for this fic. It seemed like a pipedream, but I just hit 20k, and from my planning it looks like it will end up being about 50k. 

I've missed writing so much. I didn't realize it, the only writing I've done over the past 5 years has been acedemic.

"hello, i’m an 18yo freshman college student who’s recently been feeling unhappy and struggling with decisions on what to do with my life. let me start off by saying just a year ago i was in a much better place. my family was fine, i had plenty of friends, i was in a healthy and loving relationship, and although i wasn’t confident on what i wanted to do for college i thought i at least had an idea. fast forward to today, i have been feeling miserable and depressed thinking about where my life is heading. i ended up going to a STEM focused college that was relatively far from my home because it offered me the most amount of scholarship money and was the “best” choice i could make. i’m a first gen student so my father was really pushing me into going to this school that was known for its return on investment. however, even before i accepted the decision to come here i was uncertain of coming here because i wasn’t confident in my major choice and when i visited the school i didn’t really enjoy it. however, here i am now and my life just hasn’t been going my way since coming here. i don’t fit in at all at the school and i’ve come to realize engineering isn’t something i’m prepared for and i hate the town the school is located in. i’ve made a couple of friends but there’s only one person i actually enjoy hanging out with. my relationship with my girlfriend just ended because she lost interest in our relationship because of how it suddenly transitioned to being long distance and that was something we couldn’t handle. when i came back home for winter break, right as i left to go back to college my mother told me how she caught my father cheating on her with another woman and that she’s confronted him about it. she told me that she wasn’t afraid to leave him because of what he was doing. so now i’ve been thrown all this shit at me and i don’t know how to handle or deal with it because i don’t really know who to talk to. i’m planning on transferring back home to a local college in a different major because all i know is that i can’t handle being at this school for another three years. i’ve been trying to keep myself busy and entertained with my

"I don't even know what the fuck to flair this.


Let me start from the beginning. 


I met this wonderful, wonderful girl. And she was amazing. And I fucked it all up because I am a fucking ass hole who ruined everything.

I don't joke around when I say this girl was amazing.

She literally knew me by looking at me.

She knew how I felt within hours of meeting me.

She knew what I did when I was stressed, or overthinking, or mad, or anxious.

And I really, really liked her.

I'm the stereotypical fat kid, writes fanfiction, listens to music all the time, constantly wanting to change but never doing it because I would chicken out.

So imagine my happiness when we started dating.

And I tried opening up to her and now we don't talk. 

I fucked it all up being stupid. Stupid me just pushing and pushing and PUSHING and now the ONE fucking person who actually liked me for who I was is GONE 

And it broke me.


I don't want to eat, I don't want to drink, I don't want to even look at her after what I did.

I have anxiety OCD and anger issues. But all that was gone with her. All of it.

I wear a mask everyday to school, not because of covid, but I hate my looks.

She saw my face and and didnt cringe or look away or treat me any less.

And I ruined that.

It was so stupid of me. I tried opening up and she talked a bit and I pushed on something she said, ""I know how it feels to not be worth someone""

And I pushed and that fucked it all up.

Minutes later, I got the text. ""I think we should break up. It isn't you it's me, don't feel sad thanks for being there for me.""

I wanted to change for her. For her and no one else, I wanted to better myself specifically so she could confidently say ""I am dating him"" and everyone would be happy for her.

I'm not obese, just overweight. I've wanted to change for so long and I was gonna do it when I started dating her. Then it all came down.

I've hated myself for so god damn long and the one person who cared is gone. I don't trust anyone, except her.

I don't even know what the fuck to flair this.


Let me start from the beginning. 


I met this wonderful, wonderful girl. And she was amazing. And I fucked it all up because I am a fucking ass hole who ruined everything.

I don't joke around when I say this girl was amazing.

She literally knew me by looking at me.

She knew how I felt within hours of meeting me.

She knew what I did when I was stressed, or overthinking, or mad, or anxious.

And I really, really liked her.

I'm the stereotypical fat kid, writes fanfiction, listens to music all the time, constantly wanting to change but never doing it because I would chicken out.

So imagine my happiness when we started dating.

And I tried opening up to her and now we don't talk. 

I fucked it all up being stupid. Stupid me just pushing and pushing and PUSHING and now the ONE fucking person who actually liked me for who I was is GONE 

And it broke me.


I don't want to eat, I don't want to drink, I don't want to even look at her after what I did.

I have anxiety OCD and anger issues. But all that was gone with her. All of it.

I wear a mask everyday to school, not because of covid, but I hate my looks.

She saw my face and and didnt cringe or look away or treat me any less.

And I ruined that.

It was so stupid of me. I tried opening up and she talked a bit and I pushed on something she said, ""I know how it feels to not be worth someone""

And I pushed and that fucked it all up.

Minutes later, I got the text. ""I think we should break up. It isn't you it's me, don't feel sad thanks for being there for me.""

I wanted to change for her. For her and no one else, I wanted to better myself specifically so she could confidently say ""I am dating him"" and everyone would be happy for her.

I'm not obese, just overweight. I've wanted to change for so long and I was gonna do it when I started dating her. Then it all came down.

I've hated myself for so god damn long and the one person who cared is gone. I don't trust anyone, except her.

My parents, hell no, my relatives? Oh fuck no with that, they would laugh in my face and talk about it like some type of joke.

That girl made me feel human. And now I'm nothing. Just some fat kid who plays video games all the fucking time and curses.

"Hey all, this is long because I have some things I need to say and get off my chest because I have never physically spoken them. It would mean more than you know to read it all and give me any support at all. 

I’m 20 years old lying in bed and tomorrow I start my first semester at a major university. I started at community college and took 2.5 years. I made it to a big school and I just don’t want to continue anymore. It feels like I’ve been depressed ever since I started college. I don’t know where this education is going to take me. What I do know is that this piece of paper I’ll get in another 2 years is gonna help me so much more to get a job in the real world. Yeah this is gonna sound cliché but fuck the real world. It’s just a trap where we feed the rich people and do their dirty work while we waste the majority of our lives makin paper for some rich fuck who doesn’t give a shit about me. I think this has been the base of my depression. I know this is the harsh reality and I can’t escape it, it’s weighing me down. I’m getting sick and tired of it. I just don’t know where I fit in. I have a great family and an amazing group of friends who are there for me no matter what. But, sometimes I feel like the only people I can really lay it all down for are strangers on the internet. There’s no judgment here. I worked in a restaurant for my time at community college and when I moved up to waiter it turned my anxiety up to 100000. I have anxiety about fucking everything now. I have always hated school and I dragged through community college feeling like I HAVE to earn my degree or else I am screwed. For the last year or so I’ve had persistent sick thoughts about those closest to me dying and the inevitability of those things kill me. I’m not ready for them. I’m not ready to leave home. I don’t want to leave my parents behind. The thing is, if I don’t finish school I’ll be stuck doing some bullshit manual labor job which Id hate even more. I don’t know what genuinely brings me happiness. The show One Piece does lmao. But that’s not true happiness. I’m not fulfilled once I realize that’s a fictional universe. My mom says my nerves are just making me want to give up before I start. And I know that’s in part right, but life just has me feeling trapped and I don’t know how to break the cycle. Im gonna wind up in a fucking office with people I hate doing something I probably don’t like. If I live off the grid it’s hard manual work keeping myself alive, then Im away from my parents and friends which terrifies me. I know Im gonna have to apply all that hard work at some point. It just fucking scares me. Hopefully this semester at a big school will help me grow. Im really hoping something pivotal happens in a good way. I want to fall in love but my one and only past relationships left me with trust issues. While I know life is the greatest gift ever, it doesn’t seem like it. I am not suicidal but I don’t even want to be here anymore. I wouldn’t kill myself because I can’t put my mom, or my family and friends, through that. I don’t want kids because bringing them into this shit world would be doing them a disservice. They shouldn’t have to feel the way I do. I know this has been all over the place. I’m struggling to figure out exactly what I want to say. I want to keep typing but, I just don’t know what else to right. If you made it this far thank you so much. I need people out there to just read my thoughts and tell me something, anything about what I’m feeling and what can help. I have unhealthy habits that need changing. It’s definitely contributing to my depression. It’s hard to change those habits. I think it’s all gonna start with my diet. I can’t cook, I’m too lazy or depressed to actually put effort into feeding myself well. I just think, what’s the point? I’m stuck in a perpetual cycle of shitty mood and eternal dread. I’m fucking sick of it. 

I want to tell you all something that I want. But I don’t fucking know what I want. I want peace and happiness! I want to be free!!!!! But this life DOESNT ALLOW FREEDOM unless you have a billion dollars. What the fuck can I do to make a difference? Help someone else when I can’t even help myself? IM SICK OF FEELING LIKE THIS. IVE COME SO FAR BUT CANT FIND MOTIVATION TO KEEP GOING. IVE ALREADY OVERCOME SO MUCH. IM STRONG. But man, is this taking a toll on me. ^ This paragraph just about sums me up lol. I don’t have the courage to say this to even my mom, who means more than anything to me. I won’t even say it to my best friends I met in highschool who saved me.

Starting a major university tomorrow but don’t feel like I even want to. I don’t even know anymore. Please read. Hey all, this is long because I have some things I need to say and get off my chest because I have never physically spoken them. It would mean more than you know to read it all and give me any support at all. 

I’m 20 years old lying in bed and tomorrow I start my first semester at a major university. I started at community college and took 2.5 years. I made it to a big school and I just don’t want to continue anymore. It feels like I’ve been depressed ever since I started college. I don’t know where this education is going to take me. What I do know is that this piece of paper I’ll get in another 2 years is gonna help me so much more to get a job in the real world. Yeah this is gonna sound cliché but fuck the real world. It’s just a trap where we feed the rich people and do their dirty work while we waste the majority of our lives makin paper for some rich fuck who doesn’t give a shit about me. I think this has been the base of my depression. I know this is the harsh reality and I can’t escape it, it’s weighing me down. I’m getting sick and tired of it. I just don’t know where I fit in. I have a great family and an amazing group of friends who are there for me no matter what. But, sometimes I feel like the only people I can really lay it all down for are strangers on the internet. There’s no judgment here. I worked in a restaurant for my time at community college and when I moved up to waiter it turned my anxiety up to 100000. I have anxiety about fucking everything now. I have always hated school and I dragged through community college feeling like I HAVE to earn my degree or else I am screwed. For the last year or so I’ve had persistent sick thoughts about those closest to me dying and the inevitability of those things kill me. I’m not ready for them. I’m not ready to leave home. I don’t want to leave my parents behind. The thing is, if I don’t finish school I’ll be stuck doing some bullshit manual labor job which Id hate even more. I don’t know what genuinely brings me happiness. The show One Piece does lmao. But that’s not true happiness. I’m not fulfilled once I realize that’s a fictional universe. My mom says my nerves are just making me want to give up before I start. And I know that’s in part right, but life just has me feeling trapped and I don’t know how to break the cycle. Im gonna wind up in a fucking office with people I hate doing something I probably don’t like. If I live off the grid it’s hard manual work keeping myself alive, then Im away from my parents and friends which terrifies me. I know Im gonna have to apply all that hard work at some point. It just fucking scares me. Hopefully this semester at a big school will help me grow. Im really hoping something pivotal happens in a good way. I want to fall in love but my one and only past relationships left me with trust issues. While I know life is the greatest gift ever, it doesn’t seem like it. I am not suicidal but I don’t even want to be here anymore. I wouldn’t kill myself because I can’t put my mom, or my family and friends, through that. I don’t want kids because bringing them into this shit world would be doing them a disservice. They shouldn’t have to feel the way I do. I know this has been all over the place. I’m struggling to figure out exactly what I want to say. I want to keep typing but, I just don’t know what else to right. If you made it this far thank you so much. I need people out there to just read my thoughts and tell me something, anything about what I’m feeling and what can help. I have unhealthy habits that need changing. It’s definitely contributing to my depression. It’s hard to change those habits. I think it’s all gonna start with my diet. I can’t cook, I’m too lazy or depressed to actually put effort into feeding myself well. I just think, what’s the point? I’m stuck in a perpetual cycle of shitty mood and eternal dread. I’m fucking sick of it. 

I want to tell you all something that I want. But I don’t fucking know what I want. I want peace and happiness! I want to be free!!!!! But this life DOESNT ALLOW FREEDOM unless you have a billion dollars. What the fuck can I do to make a difference? Help someone else when I can’t even help myself? IM SICK OF FEELING LIKE THIS. IVE COME SO FAR BUT CANT FIND MOTIVATION TO KEEP GOING. IVE ALREADY OVERCOME SO MUCH. IM STRONG. But man, is this taking a toll on me. ^ This paragraph just about sums me up lol. I don’t have the courage to say this to even my mom, who means more than anything to me. I won’t even say it to my best friends I met in highschool who saved me. My connection with them will run my entire life. But there’s some things I just still feel too vulnerable about. All my friends have set paths ahead of them. Im just trudging along trying to figure it out. Im not confident in where I’ll end up. I just gotta trust the process I guess. But that thought terrifies me.

"Hi reddit!

Long time reader, first time OP so I apologize if this feels jumbled or confusing.

Also warning, VERY long.

I (27F) am living in a EU country (for context).

When I was younger I tried studying Business Administration but also fell in a pretty dark place, I had no energy to do anything or concentrate. First year, through sheer force of will, I passed everything, with top marks/honorary mentions etc, but I was getting burned out. 

Second year, passed everything but 1 subject, still some excellent grades in some even, but I felt like it was getting to be too much. I couldn't tell you what exactly was ""too much"" but I felt like I couldn't keep up with anything.

 My parents suggested it was better for me (and cheaper) to do less subjects but keep grades up, so I only did like 70% courseload the 3rd year. passed half of that. In the middle of that I moved out with my gf and took a part time job to sustain myself. This is when I feel things really went downhill for me, I was already feeling out of control and slipping in all my duties (college grades, prospects, jobs...) and was always moody and extremely tired, between studying and working.

I don't regret moving out or my relationship, I was euphoric and it was a very needed boost that I thought at the time would get me out of the funk I was feeling. I would have crashed sooner without them to be sure, but they delayed the inevitable, not avoided it.

I hated what I was studying, couldn't see the point of it, so I dropped out and went to work full-time. I felt a sense of relief that I no longer had to put time into something I had grown to hate but afterwards I just felt empty, always, all the time. I wasn't sad but I also wasn't happy or excited, just null.error

\*For context, where I live its pretty difficult to get a job without a bachelors, and even with one its difficult. I once worked at a fast food chain and my coworker was doing a master in physics (he already had degree then) and said he was struggling to find something better.

I knew I wasn't going anywhere without a bachelors, but I was burned out and the thought of going back to uni made me hyperventilate and feel dizzy. I figured if I couldn't get a bachelors, that i would used what I had done and get an Associates of marketing, I managed to get that done in a year while working. 

Afterwards I Found a better job at a EU project to analyze and predict traffic safety and interventions with multiple sources, this was a 3 year project and once it finished we would all be out on the streets. To build a model, that fed on police reports, hospital data, social media mentions, insurance statistics.). I really liked it and I learned a TON.

Anyway, job ended, it was a bit of a blow, I really liked it, but knew this was coming from day 1.

My girlfriend had to go back to her home country to attend to family emergency and business and then the pandemic happened and we couldn't fly to see each other due to restrictions. Long distance ended up being the end of that. Good try though and good breakup with 0 resentment/blame.

&amp;#x200B;

I still missed her, still felt dizzy and clueless about what I wanted to do with my life and figured ""if you don't know where you are going, any road will take you there"", so I applied to a bunch of jobs without much thought. I ended up in a temp contract in sales to cover an illness. I wasn't thrilled, but at least I was out of the house and had something to do.

Sales is NOT for me, managers made it a habit to scream at people (I was lucky I only got yelled at once, department record actually) and one even threw his mouse at a senior coworker because our team was second in the performance rankings (from the top, we were second best for the first month in the entire year, we had dominated before that).

I wanted to quit and my contract was running out anyway, my boss actually did me a solid and fired me so I'd have extra unemployement days than simply waiting another 2 weeks for the contract to expire. 

I have like 8 moths of unemployment I haven't tapped into yet, so while not swimming in money my situations isn't dire by any means.

&amp;#x200B;

**So here I am now, 27, unemployed and with 0 clues of what to do. Sales taught me that I shouldn't just go after another jobs just because, but I truly have no clue where to go from here or what to do**.

Rationally I know I should get a job, go back to school, get/finish a bachelor, get in shape, and go back to dating, fall in love, stablish a house, further my career etc. 

I should, as my mother puts it, ""finally get your life together and make something of yourself"".

**The problem is, I have no clue of what I want, in part because I don't want anything**. excitement, desire, even sadness, left me long ago. I simply exist and that is enough of a challenge most days, simply going through the motions of showering, dressing, doing groceries and scouring the internet...for what?

Life feels overwhelming most days, I want to sleep my days away but I know that is unhealthy and won't help me, I am not getting any younger after all :)

I don't even know how to start figuring it out, the only thing I feel reliably is guilt and stress. I feel like in a videogame, I dodged rolled to avoid a killing blow only to roll myself off a cliff and die to fall damage, or worse, glitch through the map in an endless fall.

"I've recently graduated high school and want to get away from my home city, my friends, family etc. I want to get some independence. I'm trying to go somewhere by myself and do work there for a few months. There's quite some pressure from myself as my sister had backpacked her first year out of high school through Europe for 6 months then moved to Mexico for 6 months a year later. Feels like if I don't do something as cool as my sister I'm wasting my first few years of being a new adult. Obvs covid-19 has damped my hope to travel internationally but I can travel throughout Australia. I have such a travel bug and I want to go everywhere I can but I'm shitting bricks. It's so scary to depend on myself and my money. 

My issue at the moment is - I can't bring myself to actually take the step to do that. Such as calling employers to see if I work for them or calling hostels to see if I can stay there etc. 

How did you take steps towards your first ""proper"" adult decision to travel and work away from everything you know?

Also has anyone gone seasonal fruit picking/ farming through Australia or anywhere? What was your experience?

"I just have no idea what to do with my life. I’m extremely worried I’m wasting it and can’t sort out what the heck I’m supposed to do with it.

There’s so many amazing things in this world, so many fantastic people, places, and possible experiences. Yet, I can’t seem to sort any of it out. I’m 26, I have had to move back home after dropping out of college for the third time, I work a dead end job, I have no friends around me, and I just feel so stagnant. I take medication to help with my anxiety and see a therapist weekly. I’m trying to make things happen but they never work.

How can I be struggling so much to enjoy life when it can be so wonderful for others? Sure, there will be struggles, but I can’t seem to get past my own. I’m not as anxious as I once was and I’m at least getting out of the house these days, but I feel like I’m going to be stuck just getting by, passing the time away until I die.

Every time I’ve tried to make changes (a job, school again, moving to a new place) it has resulted in me breaking down and ending up back home. At this point it’s basically a family joke. Im tired of it but don’t see a way for it to change. Despite knowing there can be beauty in this world and I can enjoy it and make it better for myself and others… I can’t put together any of the pieces to make it so.

And I’ve tried sorting out what to do but it gets too confusing. I get overwhelmed by the limitless possibilities in front of me. How can I justify spending more time on myself versus helping others, or spending time with this person over that person? How can I put more time in a hobby when I could actually learn more skills to improve my job prospects? How can I sort any of that out? It doesn’t make sense to me.

Basically… I don’t know what to believe anymore. And I think it’s good I’m not fully indoctrinated and closed-minded, but at the same time, I’m so open to new ideas that I have no foundation from which to build my life. I can change things on a whim, crashing into one thing after another. It’s terribly frustrating to deal with.

"**This post is best suited for those who have watched Steven Universe.**

Because the show never showed it, I’m planning on writing a fic where the CGs apologize for keeping Lapis in the mirror, she makes peace with them, and decides to become a Crystal Gem.

However, I have two big problems.

- The first problem is that I don’t really understand what Lapis truly wants.

Does she want help in recovering from her mirror trauma? Her statement about the Gems being selfish in “Ocean Gem” said to me that she wants (or wanted) support or somebody to care about her.

Does she want to be help accountable and suffer consequences for her harmful actions? “Alone at Sea” said to me that she wants to be punished or seen as a bad Gem for her crimes instead of being excused for them.

What does she want from the CGs? Is she afraid of what they think of her? Does she feel the need to apologize to the Gems or is she waiting for them to apologize?

- The other problem is that I don’t know how much blame should be directly placed on Lapis (and I'm not sure if I can really blame her).

You see, I do see some truth in Lapis’ statement about the Gems only caring for the Earth and not other Gems from “Ocean Gem.” When Steven told them she was talking to him in “Mirror Gem,” they were just going to bubble her instead of figuring out what she was. They aren’t as compassionate or open-minded as Steven. If the Gems want Lapis to trust them, they need to show her that they care about her.

I also think her actual mirror trauma got swept under the rug and wasn’t explored as the reason for her bad actions. She stole the ocean because she wanted to be free of Earth and had no connection to the planet like Steven and the CGs. Her being captured by Jasper and Peridot and brought back to Earth was forcing her to relive the trauma she suffered in the mirror. IMO, Jasper grabbing her at the end of “Jailbreak” and trying to get her to fuse with her was akin to a sexual abuse victim getting groped. It caused her to snap and finally decide “*f@ck it, if I’m stuck in this hell, I’ll take Jasper down with me*.”

These are the reasons I don’t hate Lapis for what she’s done. When someone brings up her torture of Jasper or her being mean to Peridot or her stealing the ocean, I can’t help, but reflect to the above reasons.
 
However, I was recently watching the Breaking Bad episode “Problem Dog” and got to the scene where Jesse blows up at the Narcotics Anonymous leader for suggesting that he stop beating himself up and stop judging himself. Jesse argues that he shouldn’t just excuse the bad things he’s done or will do, that you can’t simply accept the stuff you’ve done when you aren’t punished for it. This made me wonder if I should view Lapis in a different light.

A **big** part of me still wants for the Gems to apologize to Lapis and acknowledge their selfishness in my fic, but I’m conflicted on whether I’m simply trying to excuse her bad actions. That I’m victimizing her too much.

I still believe that Lapis committed her atrocities because she was never given help and had trust issues. I still want the Gems to acknowledge that she needed help and didn't get it. That they promise to start caring for other Gems (as well as her).

But I'm scared that I'm defending an abuser.

"Earlier this week I saw a question trending what makes the difference between good and great writing. I think ""good editing"" was a pretty wide-spread answer there, but to further exacerbate the point, I wanted to share a case example in my own fandom.

Some author held onto a 25K word story for 4 years before finally publishing it. The author wrote in the summary that it was not even her best work, she thought. But after 4 years of editing, she figured she'd post it anyway.

This story is 99% better than any other stories in the rest of the fandom. It will probably not get a lot of traction due to timing and obscure summary, but it absolutely floored me. The prose was clean and tight. The structure was beautiful. The ending was excellent and tied up so well.

"I'm currently writing an MCU longfic, with the premise of the story being based around the addition of a reworked version of a character from the comics. 

The fic takes place in NYC, the place I live, and I wanted to rework the character to be someone I feel I could realistically know in the city, so I made her a Black woman from Harlem. So far in the fic it's established that she's from Harlem, the daughter of a single father, and low-income. I want her to be authentic to the black women I actually know (I'm black myself) and that involves uses accurate AAVE, or what a lot of people know as 'ebonics'. (Not all the time, she would have the capability to code switch like a lot of POC do.)

She speaks plainly, but I really would like to incorporate some slang into her speech, much like an accent, but as someone who speaks AAVE and has grown up around it all my life, I don't know how it would be received by readers unfamiliar with the culture.

Calling oneself a 'bad b\*tch', using slang like 'deadass', or speaking in what is typically known as 'bad grammar' (ie saying 'You ain't go no money on you?' as opposed to saying 'You don't have any money on you?') are all characteristics of AAVE that people may look down on, or not like. But it's authentic to my culture, and endearing to me. AAVE means a lot to me, but I don't know how it'll be received. 

I hardly see reflections of New Yorkers like me and my community (or communities like mine like Harlem, the Bronx, deep Brooklyn) represented, especially in the MCU, and I want to change that a bit. Besides her, the fic is populated by the (majority white) canon characters.

"**Somehow find a way to persue creative career or settle for 'less'?**

*Creative tendency and money issues:*  
I have a master's degree in performance and have had a relatively social/busy/artsy last years in the centre of the city. I finished my studies in the midst of the corona pandemic and made a digital master project (opposed to a live performance with an audience full of connections) which was well received but a huge letdown because of the anticipation I had built up years prior. The digital project was reviewed by the jury and no-one else. During lockdown I panickly tried to do this and that within the restrictions that were given but found very little opportunities as the entire art scene in my city was struggling too. There were to theatre festivals or open stages I could perform. I faced money issues after trying for a while so took on a job 4/5th a week in a flower shop and stopped persuing my career for a while. I like the job and enjoy myself but have no energy or mental space to work on art. I feel unfulfilled on a deeper level and wish I could be a full-time artist again.

*Domestic life and relationship:*  
When I was studying I thought to buy a very small boat to live on and lower my living cost to make art. But now I'm having my first real relationship. A boat is too small for us. We live in an appartement that costs way more than that boat. We both need the space to concentrate (musician + writer/performer). And in fact I don't mind the idea of sharing a cute home with a garden and a pet. But owning these things cost a lot of money and probably a lifetime of work. We could find a home outside the city to lower the cost of living, but the further away I go from the city centre, the more I'm removed from my colleauges, opportunies, possible succes as an artist.   
But it's a straightforward traject: I work in a flowershop fulltime, find a house, be content, make art in between cracks of time,... kind of feel like a loser... because of all the things that could have been. Probably feeling stuck in life here and there, at my dead-end job... Having a mid-life crisis... I realise that I am blessed with a job and a partner. But the idea of me not persuing art makes me feel like I'm wasting my life. That I could be doing better, working harder, putting in more effort.

*Nuance in decision:*  
I don't know if I'm the problem and that I should fix my perspective to be happy with the job I have. I can't really listen to my inner voice either and quit my job. I have had a few opportunities while working that I had to let go because of the job. If I would quit to take one of these (rather small) opportunities for a month or two, I'd be without income again and without a job, too. I can't repeat the process untill I've worked at every flowershop in the country. Not to mention the next generation of graduates is taking the city opportunities by storm and there is little left of allumni like me.

"Help me find my way into the harry potter fandom

Okay this might be a weird request for help but here we go :)

I was never too interested into getting into the hp fandom. I think it's mainly because I greatly enjoy romance fics and the idea of shipping any of the hp characters has always just felt kinda... off to me. Maybe because my entire childhood is at stake here lol.

Long story short I recently stumbled on a fic that was discussed in one of the threads on this lovely subreddit. The excerpt posted there was frankly hilarious so I gave it a shot. It's an explicit Fred/George/Hermione oneshot. (aaah, I *know*, right??)

Turns out it was insanely well written and reminded me that skilled authors can kinda pull anything off. It was a very entertaining read, loved it frankly!

So now, lovely folks of this subreddit: Please help me dip a toe into the fandom. It's huuuuge and dated and I have no idea what I might like. Of course, I checked out the author's other works, but the rest of the ships seemed so ""aaagh idk about that"" to me I didn't try them. Especially since I generally prefer mm slash fiction over het ships. 

Here are some preferences that are a must for me:
- well fucking written. Pleaaase, no epithets, no cringe metaphors, no excessive descriptions to blow up wordcount etc. Gimme something to be jealous of as a writer! :))
- Give me something mature. And I don't necessarily mean the rating, I mean the general vibe of the fic and how the characters respond to problems and how they interact with each other. 
- anything over 10k
- 3rd person POV

Some nice to haves:
- Angst (I'm all here for the pain baby)
- I also love a nice au here and there
- Charcters in their 20s or 30s
- Well written (!) smut
- m/m pairing
- occasional humor
- 80k plus longfics (or gimme that one 200k+ fic that tore your heart to shreds at 3am haha)

What I don't like / won't read (no bashing here, you do you!)
- rape / noncon
- incest
- underage

"This isn't a bad venting, just venting in general

So there's this story around 20k words where in every single chapter I was like ""oh, that's a good line"", ""this makes awesome for a cliffhanger"", ""wow this scene is perfect!"", ""my thoughts have been perfectly translated to words, it's so good"", ""can't wait for people to read it"". Aaaand that story didn't go that far. It has some favorites and kudos but that's about it and it's even complete.

The other side of the coin, it's a story still on-going with chapters coming almost every month, and I'm ""isn't this line too corny?"", ""ok that was a short chapter for the sake of it"", ""this battle is so poorly designed"", ""is all of this too confusing?"", ""shouldn't i check this dialogue again? nah, let it be"".

The other side of the coin, it's a story still on-going with chapters coming almost every month, and I'm ""isn't this line too corny?"", ""ok that was a short chapter for the sake of it"", ""this battle is so poorly designed"", ""is all of this too confusing?"", ""shouldn't i check this dialogue again? nah, let it be"".

"I'm 27, almost 28 in great physical shape and in a good position financially. I've got a good amount of money saved up and my overhead right now is pretty low (renting a room from family), it's just my dog and I that I'm responsible for. I have a great job that's fully remote, it's not the most exciting job but I don't mind doing it. I've got some hobbies I enjoy, I like to skateboard, hike with my dog, workout, code, play guitar...I keep busy haha. 

On the whole though I feel like I've got no direction, I've got no place of my own, no goals, no dreams, no girlfriend, no real close friends though I do have a few good ones. I just have no idea what I'm doing, right now it all kind of feels pointless. When I think about who I am or what I want to do with my life while I'm still young, I draw blanks and get stressed. I could just pack up everything I own right now in my truck and leave, staying in rentals around the country but I've got nowhere I really want to go. Sometimes I think maybe I'm depressed, but then I think well depressed people usually don't have the motivation to workout every day like I do or go skateboard when 20 it's degrees out; then again, I do really have to force myself to do these things sometimes. It's an odd feeling, things are not so bad and I could definitely go on like this until I die but I feel like I'm missing out on something. Sometimes I think about joining the military and being a part of something bigger than myself, but then I think boot camp would probably suck being 28 with a bunch of 18 year olds and it would really suck to be locked into something like the military for like 3 to 5 years if I hated it. I've thought about going back to school and trying to get a masters and maybe a phd in something (I have a b.s in Environmental Science, but work as a programmer/analyst). I enjoyed academics and always learning new things...but I do that on my own for free now and I don't have anything I'm really passionate about to study. Sometimes I think about what would happen if I won the lottery and it actually stresses me out because I have no idea what I would so with myself if suddenly I did not have to work anymore. My work gives me some purpose at least and without that I think I'd be even more lost. Weekends are the worst for me because I very rarely have plans to do anything. I enjoy the morning when I usually get a workout in and study/practice something but once I'm done I just don't know what to do. The work week is nice because before I know it's time for bed and I don't really have to think about it.

I (early twenties male) am coming into a windfall of about 100k.  
This is a life-changing opportunity and I want to treat it as such, which is why I am here. 

My goal is long-term I want to set myself for the future and not increase my current quality of life. I am in college still and will be for the next few years. But I am not sure what is the best approach as there is so much information out there.

I should mention that I am currently renting and am also currently getting financial help from the government(Fasfa) for taking classes, it is not much but it helps.

With the research I have done I am thinking my approach will be to put the money into an account so that it does not show up as income allowing me to continue to get Fasfa aid. I have already told myself I will not touch this money until after college. Once after college, I plan to use the money to make a down payment on a house. Although I can cross that bridge when I get there in a few years.

Given this is the correct approach, what is the type of investment vehicle I should put the money in while in college.

"Hi everyone! I discovered a movie on netflix 2 years ago and I became obsessed with it so i started looking for fanfiction. Most of it is Romance that ignores most of the magic system of the original work or Crossovers (which I dont really read) and in my native language i only found out no more than 20 works from 2006.

In all the years I have written fanfiction I did only AU but now I am really interested in staying in canon, the movie is the only source of canon material and doesnt answer all the questions of their magic system. But I have no idea what to add to the story besides trying to complement the magic system. Im between writing a Post Canon whole plot or writing about the past of the minor Characters of the movie, but still, i have no idea on the whole plot I would want to explore.

Is there any advice or tropes in regard of writing within canon? Like ""most ppl write the implied scenes that didnt appeared on the film"" or ""we added a new villain"".

"So I'm writing a romance fic between two characters that are 7 years apart (21 and 28) and are in a pseudo mentor/mentee relationship. Like to put it in the closest way possible that won't completely reveal what I'm writing about lol, imagine it's a fast food restaurant AU and the 28 year old is the floor manager, and the general manager tells this person to train this new 21 year old employee who also happens to be his child. And because we're suspending belief let's say that fast food retail is a sought-after career, so this general manager's actually wanting his 21 year old kid to eventually take up the position of floor manager, and the current 28 year old floor manager knows this, so they're kind of already closed off from the start with the new employee knowing that they're essentially training the person who's going to put them out of a job. But the new employee is actually a really nice person and also actually genuinely admires the floor manager for their work ethic and personality, and also pretty much has a crush on the floor manager on first sight.

The floor manager takes their job really seriously and is also really invested in being a good leader to their coworkers, so once they get over the initial resentment they actually try to train the new employee on the job. And really they don't really see each other in the capacity of a mentor/mentee, partly because the new employee doesn't really conform to the expectations for a junior staff, because they and the floor manager both know that regardless of what they do they would never get fired because they're the general manager, the actual boss's kid, and if there was ever anyone to be fired for anything, not even just a mutual romantic relationship, it would be the floor manager. Outside of work, they click, like they're a good support for each other for their personal struggles. But sometimes the new employee's youth will shine through (mostly just how carefree/worriless they are), and the floor manager will take note of it, and it's not a deal breaker for them (they think it's refreshing and gets the floor manager to have more fun but is also slightly naive), but at his worst it does make him feel like he's taking advantage of the new employee/their love, even though the new employee is usually always the one making the first move because a relationship with the floor manager is what they really want. Also, they're both bi, but the floor manager doesn't know it/has never had an experience with the same sex, while the new employee has had a lot of experience with the same sex, so when they do get together the new employee's the one who's having to guide the floor manager through their first romantic experience/relationship with the same sex.

This all kinda sounds funny to me now after plopping it into the context of a fast food AU lmao, but I just wanted to get people's thoughts about this dynamic: do you see a significant power dynamic in this relationship that's toxic/dangerous and would make the relationship unhealthy to pursue?

"Okay, I know the obvious response is ""they find them threatening to their OFC (and perhaps, by extension, to the author herself)"", but it just rubs me the wrong way, especially as I've seen it in quite a few fandoms where the male character in question hasn't even gotten with the female character in canon. 

Like, everyone is obviously entitled to their own opinion regarding a character, but the number of fics that make the canonical female character outright evil to the point of even hurting the male character is just kind of discouraging, in my opinion. I guess it's just kind of a downer, when you consider fiction often reflects the real world for many folks.

Hey Everyone.Apologies for how long this is going to be.

So, I come from an upper-middle class family. My dad is running quite a successful retail business for the city we live in and has made a name for himself in his industry. And he did all this from the ground-up. So amidst the kids of the school I went to, I used to be one of the ""rich"" kids but my parents never let me get the idea. I NEVER had to struggle for anything. Anything that had to be done, we had servants for it. If I needed stationery or something to eat or needed to go somewhere or anything like that, some worker would be instructed to take care of that. Other kids had to get all this done themselves. At the time I had no idea about the toll it would take on me later on in life. As a result of all this, I gained no street knowledge, no information about the adversities of the real world, no smartness. I just used to feel privileged (which I was, btw).

I graduated high school with average grades, got into an average college, erolled in an average computer application program and then things started to go downhill. I lost all motivation to work hard. My attitude got too casual because in the back of my mind I always knew, no one was relying on me, I can always fallback on my parents and they will handle all the consequences of my carelessness. Although I was beginning to realize that my parents' money is not gonna help me much after I'm done with college, still I didn't do shit about it. I had no aim after college. No ambitions. I barely worked on anything ever. Never participated in anything. Had no interest in socializing except with my 3 good friends. Just before my last sem was gonna begin, Covid showed up and we graduated college sitting at home. Spent good 5-6 months at home. And as the lockdown lifted, my parents asked me if there's something I had in mind for myself. If not, they suggested that I join them. So I agreed.

Now, I'm 22. Its been 2 yrs since I joined my dad's business, and I feel I am having a super tough time learning how the everything works. I have absolutely zero networking and communication skills (2 of the most crucial skills required for business). I still am not sure if this is what I wanna do but what other choice do I have? I have no skills. I find it really difficult understanding basic stuff(which had never been a problem when I was younger). I am unable to think about any new/fresh ideas to grow the business. I can't have a say in important business decisions. My money management skills suck big time. When I'm at the store, I can't find much work to do so sometimes I'm just sitting idle. I feel I'm just making a fool of myself in front of the other workers and I might just ruin my brand's name. I put off important tasks for later. I take frequent breaks even though I don't work as hard. And the thought that someday I might have to run everything here and be in the place of my dad seems so intimidating and overwhelming. Everyday I wake up miserable thinking about going to work. I don't treat it as my business, I just work as if I'm an employee there, and that too an incompetent one.

I will be super grateful if somebody could suggest some tips on how I could get better because I think I'm gonna collapse soon.

Thanks for taking the time.

"This is a pairing that I looked into 'cause I was bored, and I've taken a real liking to it. It's relatively easy to make a case on how it would happen, and there's not too much in canon to hold it back (I believe their relationship is relatively vague).

"So, I'm pretty sure I posted before about the fanfic I've been working on. It's a big crossover/fusion that basically mixes every fandom I'm a part of and ones I was a part of in the past.

It's getting overwhelming. Whenever I want to watch/read something new there is part of my brain wondering how I could add it to the fanfic omniverse that I'm trying to build.  Whether it would go into the main verse as a fusion or fuse with one of the other universes crossing over or in its own seperate universe.

The whole premise is based on how in the multi/omniverse anything is possible and any alternates are possible as well. 

Fandoms that are set in the real world (like crime shows, med-dramas, low-fantasy, realistic/modern sci-fis, some comic books, etc.) are really easy to fuse together. Earth is a relatively big world and not knowing people in other places can be easily rationalized. A police officer in NYC doesn't need to know of some rich family on the opposite side of the world or even the opposite side of the same country. Things with off world settings can be explained similarly as it being a big universe. The ""hidden worlds"" concept of low fantasy and humans trying to rationalize anything that doesn't make sense to them also helps with keeping things fused but also seperate.

The ones that get more difficult (high fantasy and such) can sometimes be mixed themselves in alternate universes. Anything with a ""known world"" concept can semi-easily be explained as the other group was originally part of the ""unkown"" portion of their shared world. 

With their being fanfics of these ""difficult"" fandoms, that are set in modern times, there is the possibility that this modern version fuses with the others and the original or a similar to original setting is an alternate universe. Also fairy-tale and story retellings, as well as adaptations and and remakes work as alternate universes as well. 

This has extended not only with books, movies, and TV shows, but also some TikTok skit series as well.

With all of this worked mostly out about when I originally realized that my ideas easily mixed together. The above explanation was made to work with the original fusion/crossover idea but it made it way too easy to fuse and mix other fandoms in as well.

So, I'm pretty sure I posted before about the fanfic I've been working on. It's a big crossover/fusion that basically mixes every fandom I'm a part of and ones I was a part of in the past.

It's getting overwhelming. Whenever I want to watch/read something new there is part of my brain wondering how I could add it to the fanfic omniverse that I'm trying to build.  Whether it would go into the main verse as a fusion or fuse with one of the other universes crossing over or in its own seperate universe.

The whole premise is based on how in the multi/omniverse anything is possible and any alternates are possible as well. 

Fandoms that are set in the real world (like crime shows, med-dramas, low-fantasy, realistic/modern sci-fis, some comic books, etc.) are really easy to fuse together. Earth is a relatively big world and not knowing people in other places can be easily rationalized. A police officer in NYC doesn't need to know of some rich family on the opposite side of the world or even the opposite side of the same country.

"I wasn't initially sure if this would be appropriate given some of the subject matter seen discussed on here, but I thought to give it a shot anyway.

So right now, I'm 21, living in a stable family, and am currently on track to get a Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.

I find the subject very interesting and it was all thanks to how my highschool calculus teacher made things fun for me. It's my last semester, I am on track to graduate in 2-3 months. I have a GPA of 3.85 out of 4.0, (mostly A or A- student), so safe to say I have really been working hard on my own despite the professors not teaching me anything. Yet despite all of this, it feels like I've learned from my education absolutely nothing useful, as all the stuff they asked me to cram into my head, though very interesting, has been forgotten in favor of cramming new info into my head. Adding pressure to this is how everyone around me is either continuing with grad school or getting jobs, and saying that I should be looking for one soon, despite not feeling ready for that at all. 

Throughout my education, my friends in my major and I have come across some very difficult classes, and for the past three/four years, I've not only extensively researched the necessary topics to prepare for exams, but I also found teaching the topics of study to my friends to be a very useful method of exam prep. This and the fact that I tutor a younger sister in all fields of highschool math as well as friends in calculus and physics made me also realize that I enjoy the process of teaching and tutoring rather than the subjects themselves, despite my lack of experience with them.

Also enter my passion project and hobby: Lego. For more context in this area, I am a Instagram content creator who specializes in building Tanks from WW2 with Lego bricks in Minifigure scale (non political but historically motivated I guess). I've been into Lego for my whole life but have started my page in 2016, and have improved since then by a lot! All the models I build come from my own creativity and hours of work. I was asked if I wanted to be part of a third party, non Lego affiliated team where I would make model kits for them. I know for sure that there is a market for this and that my existing fans would love for me to take this more seriously to create more vehicles and stuff they can build and use in their Lego dioramas. If you want a better idea of some of the stuff I do, my Instagram is @panzer.bricklabs_1944 (not trying to shamelessly insert myself). 

Which leads to the question...
I'm overwhelmed with these options. Where do I go? I feel like being part of a company as a kit freelance designer and content creator would be a once in a lifetime opportunity that I wouldn't want to pass up. Building and designing with lego is such a passion of mine that I wouldn't want to ever give it up. At the same time it's such a risk financially as I'd like to start supporting my mom and dad who have been working for my sake. Teaching is another passion of mine and right now I plan to enroll to be a tutor or something just for some income but I'm not sure if I want to pursue this path as my career. And for some reason it took until my graduation to start doubting if engineering really is my thing despite my interest in mathematics and physics. Not going into an engineering job despite spending 8k annually for college seems like a huge waste of potential and I'd feel like an ungrateful child to have squandered this opportunity due to my lack of confidence and uncertainty about going into the field.

"Hi guys! Long time no see :)

I've been working for a few weeks on an actual novel. I have my characters arcs and profiles, my detail summary and now is time to write.

But, now is time to write and I'm starting to wonder is I should make this a fan fiction instead, to have it read by people and get opinions on the story. 

What do you think of this? Is it a bad idea?

Then, which fandom. I'm wondering: twilight? Harry potter? I'm familiar and comfortable with both. 

Let me give you a quick summary:

Mia is a 17 year old girl living with a depressed mother and an absent/abusive father. She finds a refuge in the many books she reads but one day, at the beginning of her last highschool year, as she is reading in a highschool corridor, she meets Alex, her new history teacher (who is 25).
Sharing first a common love for literature, they start a forbidden love story. But will this romance really give her the happiness she is looking for?


I'm dealing with the notion of growing up, escarping abuse and your own trauma, finding who you are and of course, true love :) 


I would certainly work mostly with OCs and I already know underage is unpopular but as it's partly inspired by true events I don't really care!

"To give some context, I am 25 year old, recently diagnosed Epilepsy (at 23) male, who has been inside his 4x4 room sense the start of the pandemic for multiple reasons one, I didn't know how it would effect me, I couldn't drive any longer, and I have been adjusting to medication for the last 2 1/2 years. 

I have recently become depressed on a level I don't think I have ever experienced, I go to sleep at like 7pm-8pm and can sleep until 3pm-4pm, I have no desire to play games anymore which was one of my favorite things to do, I have missed so much work because of my lack of motivation, I have gained weight. Etc. 

My mom has had to cover some of my bills when I don't have the full amount. Even tho she knows what I'm going through, she still says ""I go through shit too but I go to work"" well we aren't the same person. Then she proceeds to tac on money that I owe her when it's not even a lot. Her and my step das both work at around the $20/hr mark and full 40 hour weeks. 

Don't get me wrong here I plan on paying her I would have anyway but the fact that it's her going off on me and tying to lecture me while I'm going this shit, and don't really have a clear understanding why it blowing my mind. 

Everybody in her life even her kids walk a thin line, and if we really piss her off or do something that she feels it totally wrong or doing her wrong we get written off, I'm a special-ish case because we are a lot closer than all her other kids I have been there through her abuse with my late father, her anxiety that she had for 5-7 years that caused her not to be able to work at all basically, etc. 

But I am at a point of, just getting up and leaving. Not even letting her know just gone. I have no friends here in TX, haven't left my room in ages, broke. 

I haven't seen my dads side of the family I'm close 7 years, 80% of my family is in AZ including my grandma which is giving me the option to live with her for free, to save money, go out, find what it is that will make me happy, make friends, look for apartments etc. and I get to see all my cousins who were all baby's when I met them so they will not really know who I am, but my aunts and stuff as well. 

The thing that bothers me is losing my mom, she will be so pissed but at this point telling her anything will cause even more drama and bullshit while I'm still here she'll go off on me, it will be tense around the house until that point and I could go on, I really feel this will be good for me , but it's just the way I have to go about doing it is bothering me. Some of my friends say that if it's best for you and that's the only way then, do it.

"So, this comes from a long story but its too much info and i don't feel like typing it all out. Basically, my mom and dad are dating and my mom is going to move in with my dad in missouri (we live in Virginia). I wont be joining her because Im in college, I don't want to move out because then the price might go up given that id then be an out of state student. In other news, I might not have anywhere to live this summer while I wait for school to start again. I think I do have the options of living with my friend or my grandma. Me and my mom have been living with my grandma since I can remember. The reason Im unsure that this is an option is because, also since i can remember my grandma has said that when my mom moves out she was going to get her own house. So she might move out right when my mom does. Along with this, she has caused me a lot of stress and she just isn't a fun person to be around for extended periods of time. So, I dont really enjoy the idea of living with her. On the other hand I could stay at my friend's house. This is a longtime friend of 14+ years. We are basically sisters so it wouldn't be weird for me to live in the same house as her and her family. However, her girlfriend did just move in with them aswell so I feel like it may just be a lot of extra people, even  though they do have an extra guest room I would probably stay in. Along with this though, they have a dog and a cat and Im not sure but I think i might be allergic to one of them if not both. Everytime I spend the night there, my throat feels scratchy in the morning. It could also be the degertent they use. Sorry, that's not the point. They also rarely have any food that I like there, which isn't a problem when I'm there for a week or so. Im fine with living off ritz crackers and popcorn every now and then. But I dont think I can do that for like 2 months.

Farah and Alex are posing as civies while undercover in Rio, as they follow a lead on one of the cartel heads

they are ordered on standby as the other 141 members are stationed in other parts of the country to gather intel

While waiting for their target to arrive in a few days both take the time to get to know each other and go on a friendly date

for once in their lives they feel peaceful in this brief moment

a far off country where they had no personal stake in the mission

which for now was just to scout the area

for Alex who was been in this missions for the CIA many times before

this is different

he is now a free man well after all the world believes him to be dead getting away with 3/4s of himself intact

price treated him as if he weren't there to save him from being arrested by his former superiors

like the silent ally he is to the 141 never officially joining

for Farah this was something new, she grew up in war, its all she ever knew she was molded by it she never saw peace until recently

she saw how beautiful the place was the lush forests and blue sea, at first she didn't understand just why the country has its own different type of war, one that wasn't fought in the open both were in a state of bliss

by this feeling

when Alex heard Farah was in Brazil he immediately went to the person he respected and viewed as his only true CO

the only person that saw through him

for who he was they bought didn't have time to process their reunion as they had their hands full during the invasion of Verdunsk

""Lovely isn't it""? Farah asked.

""yes ma'am"" he answered ""its good to see you again commander""

""I don't usually have dead men as allies"" she chuckled

the 2 of them shared a laugh and went out as they shared more about themselves as they went out for a few bites, they appreciated each others company

later during after sundown they talked about what to do next after the missions over

she asked what if he's planning on staying ""dead"" forever

Alex says he hasn't been with his family ever since he joined the CIA and he can't come back to them in fear of their safety

something Farah didn't understand

as she'd give everything just to have her parents back

she felt bad about it

""Alex, I have 2 rooms in the block I'm staying, if you need to stay you're very much welcome."" she said

""nah ma'am I'm good I'd better be going, we got an HVI to look out for""

""they will arrive here in a few days according Nikolai's intel. you look very tired Alex you need rest, come."" Farah looked at him ""that's an order."" she said jokingly.

""thank you my commander"" they both laughed

after they reach the small trailer she was crashing in the two of them shared a smoke

talked more about their past experiences there Alex opened up to her about how serving with her seeing her cause made him more empathetic, and slowly gave him back his humanity and morals after seeing Farah be a symbol her fortitude in holding on to her beliefs, the reason we willingly risked his life for her

he inched closer to her

""you gave me purpose Farah, whenever I'm with you I'm more dedicated to it as ever, I did a lot of fucked up things before and I'm trying to make up for them""

Farah was taken back but saw how he really meant what he said

""you're a good man Alex, and we have all done some terrible things we regret we just live through them ask for forgiveness and be better""

Alex was about to lean closer to her but hesitated Farah saw this put her hand on his back

""Farah.. I care about you."" Alex took his hand and returned the gesture

before long they hugged.

""I like to be always serving under you Farah""

""Alex, I like your company too. you're the first person who was openly been honest with me, even my own brother couldn't do""

Farah told her how she felt and kissed him in the forehead

""I love you Farah Karim"" he said in a whisper.

both were into the moment before snapping back feeling awkward, Alex smiled at her ""I better get some shuteye"" said. ""thank you Farah. for everything""

""I have u to thank more for everything you risked for me.. rest well Alex""

""yes ma'am"" Alex replied in embarrassed voice hiding the fact that he's bluffing

Alex went to the other room,

Farah and Alex are posing as civies while undercover in Rio, as they follow a lead on one of the cartel heads

they are ordered on standby as the other 141 members are stationed in other parts of the country to gather intel

While waiting for their target to arrive in a few days both take the time to get to know each other and go on a friendly date

for once in their lives they feel peaceful in this brief moment

a far off country where they had no personal stake in the mission

which for now was just to scout the area

for Alex who was been in this missions for the CIA many times before

this is different

he is now a free man well after all the world believes him to be dead getting away with 3/4s of himself intact

price treated him as if he weren't there to save him from being arrested by his former superiors

like the silent ally he is to the 141 never officially joining

for Farah this was something new, she grew up in war, its all she ever knew she was molded by it she never saw peace until recently

she saw how beautiful the place was the lush forests and blue sea, at first she didn't understand just why the country has its own different type of war, one that wasn't fought in the open both were in a state of bliss

by this feeling

when Alex heard Farah was in Brazil he immediately went to the person he respected and viewed as his only true CO

the only person that saw through him

for who he was they bought didn't have time to process their reunion as they had their hands full during the invasion of Verdunsk

""Lovely isn't it""? Farah asked.

""yes ma'am"" he answered ""its good to see you again commander""

""I don't usually have dead men as allies"" she chuckled

the 2 of them shared a laugh and went out as they shared more about themselves as they went out for a few bites, they appreciated each others company

later during after sundown they talked about what to do next after the missions over

she asked what if he's planning on staying ""dead"" forever

Alex says he hasn't been with his family ever since he joined the CIA and he can't come back to them in fear of their safety

something Farah didn't understand

as she'd give everything just to have her parents back

"Hello everyone. I’ve battled with Depression for a long time- pretty much since I got out of the service a few years back. I recently managed to navigate my mental state into a decent place, and depression wasn’t a problem for years. I met a girl through some work friends, and things were going great, but I hadn’t asked her out yet. I was almost 100% sure she was into me as much as I was into her, as were most of my friends. When we would hang out at group events, we would almost always spend the entire time talking to just one another, and some of my friends say they saw her staring at me from time to time with “eyes of admiration”. Fast forward a few weeks, and I decide to ask her out to dinner, and I was 99% sure she was gonna say yes. 

She didn’t. She said she wasn’t looking for romance, and really that she wasn’t the romance type at all. I totally understand that, and I still look forward to us being great friends in the future. But these last few days I haven’t been able to defeat the return of my depression. You see, she came into my life when I was struggling with addiction, and just the thought of a future with her was enough for me to curb that addiction. Even now in my depression, I haven’t regressed into it, and I don’t think I ever will. She was like a light in the darkness, and even as a friend, she can still be that light. But at the same time there is a feeling in the pit of my stomach that I haven’t been able to free myself from for the last few days, and I really just don’t know what to do. I’m sleeping through most of the day trying to escape a life I don’t want, into dreams where I can at-least pretend I don’t still have feelings for someone who won’t ever return them. I genuinely feel lost. Has anyone on here ever been through something like this?

"I don't know what to do, I can't make up my mind whether to move or not.

This is the situation: I live at home with my parents, I graduate in a month but I will have to stay in my city until June since the course in which I am graduating officially ends in June despite the graduation in March. I am very confused and dont know if I want to leave the city, but in the meantime I have applied for a job here which should start in the summer / early fall (whose pay is still low, 400 euros a month so I would still have to find another job). And I feel very frustrated because I worked this summer and now I have some money that I don't know whether to use to move to another house but still in my city (since living with my parents starts to be frustrating and also the place where I live is quite far from the center) or wait to graduate and go away to another city. I am fine here, of course I have my friends, my boyfriend, my family and I would love to stay here, the point is that I live in a city in Italy (Naples) where finding work is quite frustrating unless one wants to be exploited by being a waiter or a bartender.

I would love to move to another house here in my city but I'm terribly afraid to do it and finish all the money I have without having found any work and in this way on the one hand having to go back to my parents' house because, precisely, I ran out of all my money and at the same time I couldn't even go to another city.

Also I am quite demoralized because I had already tried about a month ago to move to another house with two of my friends but the owner scammed us and I had a really bad experience where I lost some money that I never got back. And, at last, there is also the covid situation that contributes to causing me confusion because another reason why I would like to move is because I'd like to be able to participate in events, meet new people, in short, do all the things that mainly happen in the city center and that I find it hard to do where I live now but with the covid everything is still suspended so I am also afraid to go there and there is nothing actually to do and still stay at home.

This is the situation: I live at home with my parents, I graduate in a month but I will have to stay in my city until June since the course in which I am graduating officially ends in June despite the graduation in March. I am very confused and dont know if I want to leave the city, but in the meantime I have applied for a job here which should start in the summer / early fall (whose pay is still low, 400 euros a month so I would still have to find another job). And I feel very frustrated because I worked this summer and now I have some money that I don't know whether to use to move to another house but still in my city (since living with my parents starts to be frustrating and also the place where I live is quite far from the center) or wait to graduate and go away to another city. I am fine here, of course I have my friends, my boyfriend, my family and I would love to stay here, the point is that I live in a city in Italy (Naples) where finding work is quite frustrating unless one wants to be exploited by being a waiter or a bartender.

I would love to move to another house here in my city but I'm terribly afraid to do it and finish all the money I have without having found any work and in this way on the one hand having to go back to my parents' house because, precisely, I ran out of all my money and at the same time I couldn't even go to another city.

Also I am quite demoralized because I had already tried about a month ago to move to another house with two of my friends but the owner scammed us and I had a really bad experience where I lost some money that I never got back. And, at last, there is also the covid situation that contributes to causing me confusion because another reason why I would like to move is because I'd like to be able to participate in events, meet new people, in short, do all the things that mainly happen in the city center and that I find it hard to do where I live now but with the covid everything is still suspended so I am also afraid to go there and there is nothing actually to do and still stay at home.

Should i try and see what happens? Should I maybe wait and directly change cities without even trying? Am I the only one who has been in this situation?

"Hey fanfiction, I need some help. I am very straight guy, and I never had a friend come out to me. However, I am writing a scene where a girl comes out to her best friend in a flashback.

"Hello people!

There's this fanfic that I read years ago, which I can't remember the name of either the title or author. I have laid down a fair amount of time to look for it, but no dice.

I will write down a summary of how I remember it. If you know of this fic or something like it, I would truly appreciate the help in finding it! :).

Summary/Details:
This fanfic is posted on Fanfiction.net and is about Teen Titans along with the Justice Leauge. 

The story takes place right after the ""Trouble in Tokyo"" movie from Teen Titans. Robin and Starfire has broken up and things are a bit tense in the team. And their tension truly shows itself when a bank is robbed by Two Face and his men. Robin has history with Harvey Dent, him being the last villain he fought when he was with Batman. And his presence kind of messes with Robin as they fight, along with the tension in the team. And from there, the Titans keep on facing obstacles after obstacles. 

There's a tie in with the Justice Leauge in this, along with most of the DC universe. Batman has scenes with Robin, and it's a pretty neat story with a lot of different interactions with both villains and Heroes in DC. Two scenes I remembered specifically is when Raven listens in on Robin talking to a ""shadow"" (Batman) in the Titans Tower. And I also remember Batman pointing a younger Raven in the direction of Jump City when she was denied help by the Leauge.

I don't remember many details unfortunately, but there was supposed to be a sequel. The last chapter ended on Slade's daughter being introduced, analyzing the Titans one by one under the watchful eye of Slade. Along with Demain Wayne holding a speech of some kind to the shadow assisns/Followers of Rahs. Might've been something with Sportsmaster too, but I am not sure.

The main ships in the story are ""Robin and Raven"" along with ""Batman and Catwoman"". There's a small scene where Batman and Wonder woman talk about how their romance didn't work out as well. There should be more ships like Jinx and Kidflash sprinkled in there, but I don't quite remember. 

I do remember that the author made some Wonder Woman/Batman stories too. But I don't remember a lot about them. One had something to do with Batman taking a day off, and Wonder Woman wondering why he always did during this specific day. And there was a villain attack where the villains ended up disturbing a grave yard. And Batman swooped in and was like ""I thought you people at least had some decency"" or something as they trashed gravestones and such.

Anyways. If anyone knows anything about this fanfic. I would love to hear and it would be a great help to me if you shared!

"Okay, so, a while ago, I wrote this My Hero AcademiaxGreen Lantern crossover.

I had written even a few chapters in advance, but tragedy struck me when my hard drive got fried and I lost them (along with other stories I had, silly me for not backing them up properly), and I was so depressed at the time that I lost interest and just left it there.

"It's a little off topic from fanfiction, but I am asking this because I'm thinking of writing a fic where there are siblings.

I've seen a couple posts and comments where readers with siblings could tell that a writer doesn't have siblings because in their fics they have their sibling characters call each other bro or sis unless it's as an insult I think?

Do siblings really only call each other by their names or insults? All the movies, tv shows, fics/books I can think of in english are usually like this. 

I was hoping someone could tell me if there was anything else I should know. Or just confirmation that they do indeed only call each other by their names or by insults. 

I'm sorry for my ignorance, English is not my first language. In my mother tongue we basically use brother/sister + name of older sibling, and even though I have no siblings, this also applies to cousins or people a few years older than you.

23M Grew up in MA and went to a ""special"" school. Had a Single mom who was emotionally unavailable, dad who saw me every other weekend until i was 12.  

Now,

Story time:

Just this past Wednesday, I was fired from my job (Biotech manufacturing at a very small company, &gt;50 employees). I had only been working there for a couple of months. I was a contractor so they didn't need to give a reason why either, but I can probably guess.

My work ethic is shit, honestly. I have problems with authority, I have problems staying focused, I have problems learning with minimal support, and I am chronically late. I take too many breaks and goof off on the computer or my phone very frequently. I know this all sounds really bad but honest to god, i can't find it in me to genuinely give a shit about my job. I feel like everything I do at work is utterly meaningless and it's never fulfilling for me so why bother putting in the extra effort? I'm certain that this attitude is what led to me losing this job, but I can't seem to get myself out of the headspace that work is bullshit and a waste of my precious and finite time on this earth.

I know now that I need to get a new job. I cant move back in with my mom cause shes living in a section 8 studio apartment. I feel like college is off the table since i dont have the money or time for it. I also don't want to get another job just to quit or get fired after another few months because i cant keep up the facade that i give a shit. No job out there seems fulfilling. Except maybe a substitute teacher or aid, but those jobs pay absolute garbage. and i just might get sick of those too. 

Im so lost in life and I know I need to find my way sooner or later. I'm doing my best to stay positive, I dont want to just sit around and feel sorry for myself. I want to work hard towards my dreams and do something meaningful and fulfilling in my life but I just have no idea where to begin.

" My bestfriend (20F), and I (19F) had been friends for the longest time. We were childhood bestfriends and our family know each other as well. However both of us had been apart due to going to uni at different states.

Recently she has been having problems with her boyfriend. Which she claims that her bf thinks all of her friends (including me) are not reliable people and ""unworthy"" and she should ""cut ties"" from us. There were also multiple issues between them in addition to that as well (stop social media, clothing options, career choices, etc).

A month ago, she had mentioned of a terrible argument and her bf wanted to breakup with her. She told me she was heartbroken, but she said that ""I know he is some what abusive, but I love him and just don't want him to leave."" She went to a therapist after this.

Then days later, she went to her bf's house, and I haven't gotten a message from her since ( I have been trying to contact her for several days, but I gave up 2 weeks in)

She also has deleted her social media accounts, and deleted all other messaging apps as I was unable to get a reach of her. (Other friends were also blocked / deleted as well, we have the same friend circle)

I was only able to get some slight information about her through her family. However, I've just been getting the fact that she has been ""busy with her schoolwork"" lately.

NOTE: Her family doesn't know that she is in a relationship right now.

We were childhood bestfriends and our family know each other as well. However both of us had been apart due to going to uni at different states.

Recently she has been having problems with her boyfriend. Which she claims that her bf thinks all of her friends (including me) are not reliable people and ""unworthy"" and she should ""cut ties"" from us. There were also multiple issues between them in addition to that as well (stop social media, clothing options, career choices, etc).

A month ago, she had mentioned of a terrible argument and her bf wanted to breakup with her. She told me she was heartbroken, but she said that ""I know he is some what abusive, but I love him and just don't want him to leave."" She went to a therapist after this.

Then days later, she went to her bf's house, and I haven't gotten a message from her since ( I have been trying to contact her for several days, but I gave up 2 weeks in)

She also has deleted her social media accounts, and deleted all other messaging apps as I was unable to get a reach of her. (Other friends were also blocked / deleted as well, we have the same friend circle)

I was only able to get some slight information about her through her family. However, I've just been getting the fact that she has been ""busy with her schoolwork"" lately.

NOTE: Her family doesn't know that she is in a relationship right now.

Who I am; I'm a 18yr old high school student living with my parents (uncle and dad, mom isn't family to me) and a younger sibling in rural America. I think alot of these problems are my fault and it's wrecking me 


Current stuff for me:
I feel my life is going to shit and it's largely my fault. I'm of course 18 years old now and in the last year of high school in America. I am as of now home sick and dreading talking to my dad about it; the context is I've hated school since middle school due to utter shit school and imo the start of an electronics addiction, I've since gotten better at, and thus I tried to stay home alot calling sick, or getting picked up. This didn't get better during highschool and in the end this year I missed a bit again, not as big chunks any more but still. A couple of times when I faked being sick my dad yelled at me to basically suck it up, he works all night to support the family while I am here doing jack shit (not his words but his meaning, and I can do my classes online anyways). Now I'm here actually sick and was dreading going to school cause 1 asshole us gov teacher but fine rest of day. I told my uncle when he came to check on me in the morning I needed to get Ibprophen as my headache was back and he sighed telling me to stay in bed. So I lay in bed struggling to sleep as my little brother gets ready to go to school and I hear my uncle talking about how I am basically pathetic and he doesn't wanna tell me that but he can't hold back. Now I wait till dad wakes up and have him probably scream at me again cause I didn't go to school while sick, then he's going to point out what he does for us and that my brother is so much better, and then going to talk about how I can't do anything; it happens every time in different orders.


How it all came to this:

When I was around 14 my mother and father divorced and I had to deal with the fallout after my mother basically abandoned us, going on about how she wanted to do so many things and had to take time to be young (she's late 40s early 50s now) I had so much stress to deal with added on to moving from a family house to a barely 1 person ""house."" I started to shut down, and my parents really started focusing on keeping me and my brother afloat but because of that and a whole ""thank you but the best thing is to stay out of the way"" mentality I wasn't able to learn what I needed to do, how to do it, hell I ended up regressing cause of this and am to this day feeling the fallout of that. Now that I'm becoming an adult and just coasting by I don't know how to cook, clean, drive, focus too much in things, put effort, or connect with people and in all honesty I've neglected personal cleanliness. I'm short and I'm lonely so when I was way back when I made an online persona of a tall hot muscular woman just so I could feel I was looked up to by people and I wanted to go trans, but now I'm a little more sure I'm a male who's straight and cis gender. The problem comes with all of my friends and communities I'm in being linked to that persona even an online relationship with a woman i love and a guy I like as a close friend. I want to move on but it's sunk cost, I'm weak and I can't bring myself to come out and ruin everything I worked for because when it started I was a manipulative pos

What I want:
I want to find a way to move on, I want to physically work on myself, become a better person, pursue a career I have a real chance in, and actually get in a dedicated relationship with someone that if we weren't dating could still be friends and of course 2 way respect of each other.

I want my parents to stop calling me useless to my face or behind my back then scold me for shutting down cause I'm basically underdeveloped mentally and can barely find the motivation to get up in the morning... 

I don't know what I even need to do anymore, irl help isn't an option cause no money and my parents don't believe in mental health and would only point out I've made my own bed and have to lay in it now... 

I wanna make a new account online and find more people to hang out with, call freinds, be more honest, and not worry about a web of lies a broken narcissistic past self made years ago I have to hold up cause I don't want to be abandoned again.","I'm a wreck, and I need help [18 yr old, America]",t8u05q,LifeAdvice,Life_advice_needed,1,1.0,0,1,/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t8u05q/im_a_wreck_and_i_need_help_18_yr_old_america/,1646672964,1,2022-03-07 20:09:24-05:00,2022-03-07,20:09:24,3,0,20,"I'm a wreck, and I need help [18 yr old, America] [Disclaimer; while I do feel like shit I am not and will not ever seriously consider suicide.

"Hi Reddit! I’m new here, but I feel really lost and confused about the current stage of my life and I’m hoping for some great advice/words of inspiration from some kind strangers. 

I’m 23 and I recently graduated university and moved to a new city for job. I’m depressed and my family really struggle financially so the move was great to escape my reality, however unfortunately I’ve racked up a couple thousand pounds in overdraft debt and I feel like I can’t save anything with my current lifestyle. I really struggle with money and I’m finding it all really difficult. 

I just got a new job that pays more but even still I can’t afford to rent and live and save all on my own. I was hoping to stay in my current house share but I’ve had my tenancy cancelled for smoking (in hindsight, terrible choice). I haven’t really made any friends here outside of my housemates who all have their own individual friends and partners and they don’t really get me as a person. I have been looking to move somewhere new and get my own place while I try and save but I can’t trust myself to be disciplined. My family have offered to let me move back home but we don’t have much space and I would have to share a room with my mom. I feel like everything sucks and I’m stuck in a loop where circumstances just keep getting out of hand.

"21 (M), if that even matter, also want to be clear after re reading I realize is can sound depressing this, I am happy and enjoying life so don't worry about that

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways I've moved out of my parents house 6 months ago now, and therefore I guess I'm an independent grown up, and I've noticed that I have become a lot more serious, which to be completely honest is not something I'm happy about, I feel like I'm taking life too seriously and not as excited over things (for example, meeting girls, after some bad situations I find that I do not let myself get excited as to not let myself get hurt). 

Also, things that were fun when new have become chores (cooking was fun for a bit and now I do it to survive)

So my question/advice needed is from other ""grown ups"", what do you think growing up means, Is this lack of excitement just a bi-product of getting older, and if not what can I do to change it.

Is growing up just having responsibilities and having less freedom in that regard (I.E. not beyong able to fuck off and play Halo for the next 3 months because rent, growth or whatever).

"I’ve been living 1,100 miles away from home for two years now to finish up grad school. I really like it here. I have close friends, a new boyfriend, and a part time job. My grad program recently extended my graduation date for “COVID” reasons, but allowed us to do school completely online if we’d like.  

With that option, I feel like maybe I should relocate a little closer to my parents. I’m a part of a very close knit immigrant family, where only my nuclear family is in the states.

"my go-to fanfiction au has been romance college aus for a while now. and while I have written my fair share of plotlines in this au, I feel like the genre can be repetitive with its story progression (usually starting with the main character going to a frat party where they meet the guy that they'll inevitably end up with). now that I'm back to writing, I wanted to make something new and challenge myself, as well as do something different with the genre, but I have no idea where to start or what plotline I should use.

"Fuck. It’s been a weird week. 

Throwaway account for privacy reasons, as much as I can manage. I’m a young adult and I’ve always felt my life is going nowhere. I have passions and such, but with climate change and late stage capitalism and the rest of the way life is, it doesn’t feel like we have many years left. Pessimistic, I know, I try to not freak myself out about it too much and I try not to freak out my friends either, because I don’t want them to feel helpless the way I do from time to time. 

I guess, the most recent shit to I’ve gotten myself into is things were going really well with a girl I like. We kissed, she said she didn’t want a relationship (for a ton of reasons, that I understand and respect). But fuck, I’ve liked her for over a year and I didn’t think anything would happen so I was trying to bottle it up. We’re just friends now same as we were before and it feels normal. And I think we’re on the same page now. I don’t really have a therapist or anything, I didn’t know how to handle this. 

Weed doesn’t usually help me but it’s what I went to, because that’s what other people do to numb the pain or whatever, and yesterday I overdosed.

I’m still recovering but I’m okay now, and I’m really, really lucky my dad didn’t need to be called (older sibling on my emergency contacts came instead).

"I posted about this on a fandom specific subreddit but didn’t get too much traffic. I’m looking for a specific fan fiction from the Artemis Fowl series. I only remember vague snippets and no direct quotes which has made searching really hard. A little bit of context: I was really into fan fiction back around 2012-ish but when I wanted more content sometimes I would go through older fics so it could have pretty much been from any time before then. All the stories I read contained Artemis Fowl and Holly Short to some capacity and I read a lot of fics shipping them but but occasionally read about them platonically. So I am not sure if this fic was shipping but I feel like it wasn’t. At the height of my obsession I didn’t know that AO3 even existed so I’m 99% sure I read this on FFnet.

I don’t remember the conflict of the story but the solution was for Artemis, Holly, and Butler to jump off a plane over a mountain and get teleported to some strange place where they were put through different challenges. I think when entering this place/plane they are separated and upon regrouping we find out Holly has lost her magic. I remember one task was for them to get on a boat that had a couple humans on it, the tasks were for fairies so trusting humans is hard for them. There’s some point where Butler is carrying Artemis and Holly (who are unconscious, likely due to the previous task) through a dessert, when Holly wakes up he puts her down and she sees her footprints are bloody from the burning of the sand. Butler reassures her the bleeding will stop eventually, I think he’s upset at her during this scene for a reason I can’t recall. Later on Butler dies. At some point after that Artemis and Holly get cornered by creatures(?), they throw their meager food supplies at them as a distraction and have to dive underwater to swim away. When they emerge on the other side one of Holly’s eyes has been gored out by one of them (to fully escape I think they climb a ladder out of that cave(?) area). Later Holly dies by falling down a cliff, there’s a bit where either Artemis or the narrator describes her body breaking on the rocks on the way down. Artemis survives the challenges and somehow gets back to reality and I think both Butler and Holly are alive back in their normal plane of existence when he does so. Maybe because he succeeded? Or because death was simply the way out of that plane? I remember it being fairly long and I believe it was completed. I am not 100% certain, because I don’t really remember an ending but to be fair I don’t remember the beginning either.

For all I know maybe this isn’t even just from one story, like I said, I read a lot of fan fiction and could have accidentally combined a few together in my memory as years passed. I remember enjoying the story hence why I’m looking for it but acknowledge that this is a long shot.

"Just something I've been thinking about for a little while. Basically, I'm straight as an arrow, and with the application of a little self-awareness I believe it's the reason why even though M/M and F/F ships and pairings are by far more common and popular, I tend to find more interest in M/F pairings and ships, not just in what I read but what I write as well.

Now, before I go any further, I'd just like to make something clear: I have absolutely **NO** problem whatsoever with the existence and prevalence of M/M or F/F pairings and ships, canon or otherwise, I would **NEVER** put someone down for liking them (If anything, more power to those ships and the people that like them), and I do believe that there are plenty of good M/M and F/F ships and pairings out there. What I'm saying is that I simply find that if I'm looking for a fic based on a ship/pairing or if I'm writing a ship/pairing, I tend be more interested in M/F ones since it's the direction I go in.

As such, I pose the question in the title: Is what I've just detailed considered wrong in the eyes of fandom? I look forward to reading what people have to say.

I'll be blunt, I've failed calculus 3 times and cannot retake it anymore and that pressure alone has been hard on me because while I don't want to find a career involving math, I want to find something that I enjoy as a career and a lot of what I've enjoyed and been told I'm good at involves the sciences or technology which generally require minimum calculus. I've been told and heard many times that I shouldn't let failures bring me down, ""It's only temporary"" they've said, but I can't help but beat myself up over it. 

It kills me mentally to realize how behind I'm becoming when it comes to life, my little brother is about to start college, and man that messed me up when I realized that ill only be a year ahead of him when we are 3 years apart. The idea that I can't help but think every time is how if I had just decided on a major, focused my hardest on school, and passed all my classes, how I'd be in a much better place right now. How I'd be closer to my goal of becoming an adult and living my life how I want without the parental restrictions I've had on me my entire life of when to sleep or how much I can play games just stuff along those lines. And this is a common theme but I can't help but again, hurt myself over it. ""You could've been better"" ""Why aren't you fixing your life?"" ""Become a fucking adult already, why aren't you?""""You've messed up your life already"". I wish I could just pass through school in a snap so I can get on with my life, I hate having to put myself through this education just to make sure I get this piece of paper from a good school that will get me my happiness of a good job that I truly enjoy. I just want to move back to my friends, to live on my own with no restrictions, because that is what I find makes me happy and right now I have none of that. Half the reason I play games anymore is to feel something and/or to interact WITH my friends that I can no longer be with in person every day.

I wish I could instantly change my habits, I've tried but I haven't been able to and always have resorted to reverting to my old ones. I play games and a lot of them, it's the only stuff that makes me happy anymore and the majority of the time because I'm on with my friends. I don't want to cut this out of my life but it's being told to me that eventually, I have to give it up. I love games and anime, but I can't just get rid of it so easily. I've tried to cut back on it but eventually I just go back to postponing everything else for it and never get anything done. I know if I had self-control I'd be well on my way to my desired future, I WANT TO BE SELF CONTROLED. But i've tried, I've tried so hard to just drop my entertainment to work on my future but every time I come back. I hate this part of me, I have the desire to fucking do something but NEVER do it. I wish I'd just act on my want to become a person I see but I don't and it fucks me up. And I cry constantly because of this, it's painful to see myself not become or actually work towards being who I see I wanna become.

Lastly, as it's been seen as a common theme, I beat myself up constantly over everything. I've been told everything in the book about how unhealthy it is, and how I could change this. But nothing has ever seemed to help, I just hate myself for not being able to be my own ""correct"", for failing calc, for being behind, for not becoming who I know I could be. I quite literally cuss myself out about everything I do, leading me to worry about my ties and bonds to everything around me, such as a friend just briefly leaving after a tough game and I go and overreact believing it was my fault and panic...etc. I know eventually once I'm in a place where I have a good job, live by myself well, and am able to enjoy my life how I want it, I'll be fine. But I'm having trouble even believing I will get there, I can't even take the max like 18 credits because of how much I don't focus my life and dedicate to studying, I may WANT to do that but I don't. And I hate that I don't, And I want to change but I can't because I know I'll just go back to playing games all day and wasting money on classes and failing them because I didn't study at all. I hate all this about myself and just wish I could be better. It's all so painful and I wish I could just have it all fixed already because it's gotten to a point where I feel nothing but pain every day about everything when I used to be so happy with my life. Now I can't help but believe that every smile I give is just fake because I honestly don't know if and what makes me happy anymore. 

Anyways thanks for reading, I know it's a mess of a post, I didn't know how else to write it out because I was just sporadically typing out my feelings. I apologize if this is another common situation of a kid who just got out of high school a couple of years ago situation I just know I'm not the only one feeling this kind of stuff but I can't help but feel like it's just me feeling this way, since well I'm the one hurting as I'm typing this ofc not trying to disregard their feelings, anyways it's a weird thing that I'm sure there's a scientific word for it that describes our sole existences and how we perceive it over others like a ""woe is me"" sorta thing.

"I like this guy a lot, we are friends and honestly want to start dating down the line. I also have to note the dad has ZERO idea that me and him like each other, unless we decide to start a relationship.

He did apologise (although half heartedly, IMO), but I need some time to get over the discomfort.

My crush believes he did say these things, but doesn't believe his dad will follow through (in his words, his dads personality is naturally flirty).

"When I was 15 and 16, I dated a boy named Frank. He was the most amazing person ever. He was so kind and caring and loved me for who I am.

"Hey, I am looking for advice or encouraging words, if you will.

A bit of backstory:

I have always been THE art kid. No matter what kind of career I was interested in people would tell me to ""not waste my potential"" and go the art route. After school I joined a 2 year graphic design course and already felt myself not really enjoying it. Still I graduated doing something I enjoyed. 
I illustrated a book.

I started studying Multimediadesign right after school thinking this would be MY thing since I was incredibly interested in animation and interactive media. The first year everything was fun fine and dandy.

For the record , I am neurodivergent, had a shite childhood and struggled with gender identity so my ""formative years"" and the process of finding myself were not finished...not at all.

Simultanously to my studies I was fortunate enough to start my transition from female to male.
...

Five years down the line.

I started therapy and am working through trauma. I am engaged to my absolutely loving, gentle and supportive boyfriend. I have worked as a designer for a year and have finished several projects in multimedia design. None of which I really enjoyed apart from those I was able to illustrate in.

I am five years into my transition and just start to turn into who I am. I am starting to love my body and my identity.

But during those five years I lost all passion for design and art. Infact I hate the thought of working as a designer again. The constant pressure of being creative, the competition, the requirements. I am burnt out. I hate every waking minute. All I really want to do, and still wanna do is illustrate. But for myself.yet I ignored my own red flags and pushed through. The pandemic only made it worse. At least I realized that I enjoy illustration the most.

Last year started working in an animal welfare center and the work is beyond refreshing. I LOVE every minute of it though I am only volunteering in the administrative office. I come home and feel creative. As soon as I think about having to design for work..I feel depressed. 

I had my ninth panic attack this week.
I need to make a decision.

And that decision included getting a ""regular job"" at a cafe and slowly starting to built my freelance career. Still I feel like I am throwing away my degree and education. In the end..all I wanna be os happy and designing fulltime makes me severely unhappy....and I wanna feel love for art again.

"So when I was a senior in high school I was taking a shower in my parents bathroom. Their bathroom had a lot of windows and the outside of it was our backyard but I am always paranoid so I like to close them when I can. That night when I went to close them (I was already undressed to hop in afterwards) I see my dad outside the window looking into the bathroom while drinking a can of beer. 
I dashed outside after throwing on a towel to see if he was still there and he was just sitting down in the living room and I asked him in an alarmed tone what was he doing. He shrugged it off and I told my mom immediately and her reaction was ""he probably thought that I was showering and wanted to see me"" even though he knew I was the one showering and even then it's weird that he'd be outside trying to see his wife like some sort of wierdo. 
After this I was very distant with my dad and was trying to find a way to bring up the topic again with my mom. My dad would randomly bring up the topic of ghosts and spirits in the house to cast the blame on the house being haunted and that it wasn't him I saw. 
After a few days of mental torture and deliberation I finally worked up the courage to talk to my mom about it. She told me she doesn't want to believe my dad would be capable of such a thing and that she would be a mother before she would be wife. She also asked me if I wanted her to ask him about it and I told her no. 2 days later she comes to my room to tell me she asked him about it despite what I said and she said he insisted it wasn't him. In the end she chose to believe his word against mine and it broke my heart. 
I thought about past experiences with my dad to see if there was any suspicious behavior that I may have overlooked when I was younger. I recalled that my dad would always need to use the bathroom when I was showering. We always have had 2 bathroom and he would always go to the one I was in. I also recall other details but it all build down to the same thing. I would mentally be angry with myself for being so ignorant and not realizing sooner that his behavior was odd but then I remember that I was just a daughter trusting her father. If I had to give an age as to when i remember his suspicious behavior I would say since I went through puberty so 12/14. 
I am now 20 years old and I ran away from home a couple months ago and I still keep in contact with my parents and I honestly don't know what to do about how I handle my relationship with them. My dad still doesn't think he did anything wrong and I honestly believe he may feel so guilty by his own actions he chooses to believe his own lie. And I am upset that my mom believes him over me after saying she's be a mom first. There are other serious conflicts I've had with them but this one is the one that concerns me most right now. Any advice? Am i maybe looking too hard into it?

She told me she doesn't want to believe my dad would be capable of such a thing and that she would be a mother before she would be wife. She also asked me if I wanted her to ask him about it and I told her no. 2 days later she comes to my room to tell me she asked him about it despite what I said and she said he insisted it wasn't him. In the end she chose to believe his word against mine and it broke my heart. 
I thought about past experiences with my dad to see if there was any suspicious behavior that I may have overlooked when I was younger. I recalled that my dad would always need to use the bathroom when I was showering. We always have had 2 bathroom and he would always go to the one I was in. I also recall other details but it all build down to the same thing. I would mentally be angry with myself for being so ignorant and not realizing sooner that his behavior was odd but then I remember that I was just a daughter trusting her father. If I had to give an age as to when i remember his suspicious behavior I would say since I went through puberty so 12/14. 
I am now 20 years old and I ran away from home a couple months ago and I still keep in contact with my parents and I honestly don't know what to do about how I handle my relationship with them. My dad still doesn't think he did anything wrong and I honestly believe he may feel so guilty by his own actions he chooses to believe his own lie. And I am upset that my mom believes him over me after saying she's be a mom first. There are other serious conflicts I've had with them but this one is the one that concerns me most right now. Any advice? Am i maybe looking too hard into it?

I (F27) have just returned back from work after maternity leave and I have a persistent itch to get out of my city.

"I’m a 26F who recently came back to live with my parents. I took a $15 an hour job with great insurance and vacation time but than the rent went up in my jobs area and the people I was going to move in with got pregnant so that fell through. I now am working this job which is 1hr and 20min roughly from my house so I have to leave at 5:30am, get there by 7, and leave around 4 to get home around 5:30 if I’m lucky. I make enough to pay my bills and save a lot, but it’s not enough to move out closer to the city. I’m applying for new jobs in my company, but no one seems to be getting back to me on anything and I’m starting to lose hope. I’ve started to apply outside of my work and recently became a live in caregiver at nights for my grandparents who live next to my parents. I’m exhausted. I wake up and have 30min to get out the door and when I get back I only have 3-4 hours before bed so I can get my 8hours. In between when I get home from work and bed I cook, clean, and help my grandparents get ready for bed.

My Mother recently talked to me about getting a second job, one for the weekends or the afternoons after I get off work. I tried explaining to her I was already burned out from this job where I’m on my feet all day, the 3 hour drive I have to do everyday, and caring for my elderly grandparents at nights, but she used the ‘I had 2 jobs to support you kids’ which is all good thank you for your sacrifice, but I actually want to have a life? I did everything right I thought and here I am back at their house for a 3rd time. Now with this stuff and Russia I sat back a second and thought ‘is this worth it?

Their comments on my fic are still there, but why then delete *my* comments from their work if they suddenly don't want to be associated with me? I honestly don't know what I could have done to upset them so much.

The premise was that Erik was a spy/working for the government to take down Nazis/Nazi groups and sympathizers and Charles has a connection to Shaw via Kurt Marko. Charles is not a spy, but he goes undercover because Shaw is known to be interested in men (there is period typical homophobia, but not from Erik's end)? Near the end of the fic, Shaw figures out that Charles is a spy (he noticed that Charles had swiped a key that opened a cellar that had some black powder/substance in it) and he and Emma basically start secretly poisoning Charles because their cover is blown and they'd be killed by higher up Nazis. Erik notices that Charles stops showing up to their check-up meetings and basically breaks into Shaw's home to save Charles, who is basically almost dead from being slowly poisoned. There are higher up Nazis at Shaw's house and it's implied that Shaw and Emma are killed because of everything I think? And at the end, Charles is wheelchair-bound and loses his hair and Erik leaves his job, but they're both alive and together.

So I was part of this friend group my old job, where I felt like I didn't quite fit in. Except with one guy, (let's say Kyle). He was nice to me compared to the girls in the group, and always included me in things. For example, if everyone was going somewhere together, he would  see me and invite me. We also had some favorite shows in common, and we'd talk about them for a while. However, I noticed that one of the girls in the group (let's call her Jackie) had her claws in him-- sometimes when he would be talking to me, he'd suddenly say, ""Jackie doesn't like it if I say that.""

However, he and Jackie weren't in a relationship. But she would always cling on to him. For example, there was a Halloween party, and she pretended to be drunk so she could literally cling to him all night. This other time I mentioned in front of both of them of the time I gave him a lift, and she got quiet and was visibly unhappy. 

I didn't understand their relationship because he would hang out with her outside of work, and didn't give me a response anytime I'd propose getting dinner too. So I thought he truly wasn't interested in me. 

He had to move back to Texas for work (since we were in NJ). We had a long talk a few days before he left, but I didn't tell him how I felt because guys had treated me like crap once they found out I liked them. He didn't tell me anything either. On the day he left, he looked like he was going to cry after he hugged me. 

After that, I just tried to move on, thinking he never liked me. Plus Jackie and I worked together, so I didn't want contention with her. A few years later, my sister told me that Kyle probably liked me, and he was afraid to act because Jackie had a higher position at work. 

I just rolled my eyes and cut my losses because I used to talk to him on Facebook from time to time. However, he'd stopped responding last year. Sister def thought he had a girlfriend. 

Lately, I added him on a different online platform, and he started messaging me. After that, we texted for 2 hours non-stop about our lives, and then for like 1 hour a few days later. However, I notice that he doesn't reply much to me again now, other than a few words. I subtly tried to find out if he has a girlfriend, but he hasn't given me a straight answer. 

What do you guys think? If he didn't like me as a friend at least, why did he text me for so long? And then why did he suddenly stop? (If he was an online dating guy, I'd get it. But I'm confused because we're friends...or I thought we were?)

TLDR: Crush from old job started talking to me again, but abruptly stopped. I hinted at the question if he has a girlfriend, and he never gave a direct answer. I'm guessing I should move on?",Crush Suddenly Stops Replying to me,srxcfw,LifeAdvice,Sandu1998,1,1.0,0,1,/r/LifeAdvice/comments/srxcfw/crush_suddenly_stops_replying_to_me/,1644798756,1,2022-02-14 03:32:36-05:00,2022-02-14,03:32:36,2,0,3,"Crush Suddenly Stops Replying to me Hello,

"# Context

 I am a 23M dropped out not too long ago just a year before i would've graduated, currently working part time 20hrs a week in a min wage job. I made 5 figures in crypto this year, which covered alot of student debt, however I since deleted all my crypto exchange accounts and turned off notifications for all crypto stuff as I didnt see it as a good way to focus my time.

I now value my time alot and don't want to work more than 40hrs/week because last time it left me resenting work and feeling depressed for a long time.

I now realize how important friendships are. I don't think I am very social but at my work I find myself talking to people and socializing more than working because I enjoy it so much. It was because of covid that I found this out and I no longer see my friends that often because we all live like an hour away from each other however we do talk in groupchats everyday.

I live at home and my family bought a breed of dog (7months old) that needs intense exercise (2hr walks) and lots of stimulation all day, for which I am primary provider of and if I am not here he wont get the exercise he needs and I carry that guilt with me all day which makes me feel like shit.

I have a gf who is finding lots of success in her career and shes going to be moving in her own house soon, which I could be moving into as well but I just don't have enough monthly income to justify it, however I really want to move in with her and get my life going.

I guess i have always been a very ambitious person I have started a few side businesses that have worked a bit and failed or I just gave up on it because I didn't find it worth while anymore, but that leads me to why I am here today.

# Decisions Decisions.....

I need to make a decision.... and to me this decision feels very important in the trajectory of my life, so i guess i am looking for second opinions.

**Option 1**, I have the option to become a certified Trainer and then apply to some jobs at gyms around here however the demanding schedule of a trainer requires you to be available 5am-7pm. As much as I like fitness and how I have been successful with gf friends and family and helping them get to their goals idk if I want to have my schedule that occupied. This would be good because I know I would do well and likely move up in company very fast plus I would have the monthly income to move in with gf and I would be able to socialize everyday. Negatively, I could be taking the short term opportunity here and maybe if I waited a little longer one of the opportunities below would've lined up, plus I would also not have any time to take care of my dog.

**Option 2**, I currently am running ads to sign up clients so I can train them in my area, however that also takes a bunch of time and mental stamina and money. The benefit of this is if I can get it off the ground before I run out of money it could be very rewarding, however it will take alot of time to get it to the place where I earn enough to move out with gf. This feels very isolating to me, as I wouldn't have any coworkers to socialize with for a while. 

**My third option** is more outlandish and involves me not getting paid at all except I would meet cool people and those connections could possibly rocket launch my career.

I want to cold email a few people I find really interesting and find a creative way that I could help them save time with their tasks and they don't pay me anything they just show me how they work and what they do, like an unpaid intern. Once again this will take at least a few months and I wont make any money right away and nothing is guaranteed, however I could make important friendships along the way. This would be amazing for socializing because I have so many questions and I am genuinely eager to learn from a select few individuals that I admire and it seems like alot of fun, however its definetly a weird one to explain to family at holiday dinners though.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk why but for the first time in my life I feel like taking any hourly job for me personally is a sellout and I will regret it. As easy as it is to get a job, and how nice it would be to make decent enough income to move out right away and how nice it would be to have a lot of coworkers around to talk to, it kinda makes me feel sad even thinking about it.",I have a decision to make..,t5gj5j,LifeAdvice,LethalMentalDeficit,1,1.0,0,1,/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t5gj5j/i_have_a_decision_to_make/,1646273511,1,2022-03-03 05:11:51-05:00,2022-03-03,05:11:51,3,3,5,"I have a decision to make.. # Context

"So, the story is about a trip from day to night, but I may have made it a little *too* long for a one-shot (about 10,000+) And I was wondering, how should I post properly? 

The base story is about 9 sections with lines between them, but the problem is that 6 are about 5,000 while the other three are the same length. I wanna try to make the story less intimidating, but I'm not sure exactly how so, since I still wanna conserve the ""outdoor trip"" feeling.

We look forward to having you there with us!


**WHAT IS THE “PINK MOON OBSERVATORY”?**


The Pink Moon Observatory (or “PMO”) is a special fan-made site dedicated to the popular Inuyasha pairing Sesshomaru/Kagome.  The site is named after the famed “pink moon” that occurs in April, the month of Kagome’s birthday!


This site has been in development since the beginning of November 2021, and will host fan-made content like fanfiction and fanart, as well as blog posts, special events, and community forums!  It’s a brand-new, updated refuge for our little corner of the IY fandom, and we’re so looking forward to having you with us.


**LAUNCH DAY**


Starting April 1st – and continuing every Friday for the month of April – exclusive content created by your favorite SessKag artists and writers will be posted to the site.  There will even be an Open Creation Day each weekend, where anyone can post their content and be featured on the site!  We encourage all SessKag creators to participate!


**FOLLOW US**


The Pink Moon Observatory is on Tumblr (https://thepinkmoonobservatory.tumblr.com/), Twitter (https://twitter.com/PMO_Social), and Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/pinkmoonobservatory/)– and we even have a Discord server (https://discord.gg/BjJzPcDV4z) with our growing community – so come say hello to us!

"So some background on me, I'm from a very religiously traditional Pakistani family. I did my Bachelors in New York but then came back to Pakistan because honestly, compared with the hassle and work of building up a life alone abroad, my life here is very comfortable. I live in my parents house, which is considered a very normal thing here. Even if I got a house of my own my parents would move with me, there is basically no concept of separating from your fam, which honestly I have no problem with because I like my family life. I work in the family business and used to do a lot of freelance work on the side, and considering I live in Pakistan anything I made from freelance alone was enough for pretty good living. 
But slowly im getting older 27(M) and for a guy here it's a huge deal to not be married yet. I have no interest in getting married, but there is a lot of family pressure. Jus FYI arranged marriage is the common custom here. Eventually I gave in and got engaged, but that engagement was broken due to a unexpected and honestly unlikely reasons. Now its been a few months and honestly I'm still not over that whole ordeal but my parents are already trying again to ""arrange a marriage"" for me and they're going at it full force because somehow they see it as their failure that I'm not married yet. 
Honestly I don't wanna deal with that but considering I live under their roof and a lot of my lifestyle is dependent me working the family business, I feel stuck and obligated to do as they say. I've considered moving abroad but I don't have enough savings for that. I've considered applying for masters but I'd have to pay for that myself and again I don't have the savings for that. My main source of income is the business, and unless and until I become completely financially free from my parents influence I'll always feel a sense of obligation to do as they say (because even though they don't understand, they're not malicious, it's jus they're from an older time and they cannot comprehend me going through life unmarried).
I was taking a break from freelance to relax after my engagement broke but I'm gonna start that back up to build up savings but honestly I don't feel it'll be enough. I don't know what direction to go in career wise, or in terms of my personal life. If I do move abroad to study/work I'll have to give up my entire lifestyle and all my family and friends but if I stay I'll eventually be pressured into a marriage and somehow that seems just as bad if not worse (just based on the horrible marriages I've seen in general and on here).
I don't even know what advice I'm asking for, my brain kinda stops working when it comes to my own life. I'm really trudging through my days right now, any direction or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

"How do you usually write this kind of relationships?

"There has been endless research and writing done on the topic of story  structure. If you’re looking to write a novel, you have your pick of  plot outlines and breakdowns to choose from, storybeat by storybeat and  scene by scene. However, there’s significantly fewer options out there  for writing shorter stories and novellas.   

One of the real beauties of fanfiction is that there is no word count  requirement. A fic can be as long or as short as the author feels it  needs to be to tell the story they’re trying to tell. This can be  freeing, but it can also be frustrating, since this kind of freeform  writing is almost impossible to find resources for. Sure, you can (and  arguably should) study novel writing and adapt the information there to  suit your needs, but it would be nice to have more advice designed by  fanfic writers for fanfic writers.  

With this goal in mind, I’ve decided to put together chapter breakdowns  of varying length, to be used by fanfic writers in structuring and  plotting their stories.  

So, like the title says, here's my ten-chapter Found Family Trope fic outline.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapter 1: Hit The Ground Running.** Drop us right into the middle of the protagonist’s conflict or struggle. Don’t waste any time with buildup -- we have limited space and since this is a fanfiction we already know these characters anyway. Give a quick rundown of the setting and powers at play, and establish the protagonist’s Goal.

**Chapter 2: Another Option.** The protagonist is offered a different way to deal with their conflict -- a way that compromises their Goal or conflicts with their Lie. The person making the offer has good intentions, but the Protagonist is set in their ways. They refuse.

**Chapter 3: Second Guessing.** Something happens that forces the protagonist to reconsider their current path. They lack something necessary to achieve their Goal, and don’t have the resources to acquire it. They reluctantly decide to set their Goal aside for now to take the other option.

**Chapter 4: Putting Down Roots.** The protagonist, in spite of themself, begins to form attachments with and a fondness for this new world and the people therein. They continue to tell themself this is only a temporary fix, and they’ll be off as soon as they’re able. 

**Chapter 5: Trouble Returns.** The more time the protagonist spends in this new world, the more they find themself reluctant to leave. They learn something important about their new world -- some threat or danger that their allies face. Their Lie is called into question and they begin to glimpse the Truth, however they remind themself they have a goal, and resolve to leave as planned. No sooner have they re-established their conviction than their past returns.

**Chapter 6: Do Or Die.** The protagonist’s New World is in danger from their own past, and they are faced with a choice -- leave the New World to continue seeking their Goal, or abandon their Goal to protect the New World. They may deliberate, but ultimately choose to stay. The way they do so is by taking on a personal mission or task that will force them to confront their Lie.

**Chapter 7: Face The Past.** The Protagonist takes off on their task, and are very nearly unable to complete it. They are assaulted with memories of the past and their own weakness, the Ghost haunts them, but the time they spent in the New World has made them stronger. They struggle but manage to endure the danger.

**Chapter 8:  False Victory.** With help from their allies, and the strength they’ve gained from the New World, the Protagonist is able to overcome the challenge they’re facing. They take a moment to breathe and celebrate -- but the second wave of danger rises on them unexpectedly, and threatens to be more dangerous than the first.

**Chapter 9: Second Coming.** The new world is not without danger -- the shadow over the protagonist’s allies has arrived, and they must all work together to see it overcome. The protagonist puts their trust in their allies, solidifying themself as a part of this new world, and together they formulate a plan to take on the threat.

**Chapter 10: Climax and Resolution.** With their teamwork and ingenuity, the protagonist and their allies are able to overcome the danger they face. They may banish the threat entirely, or merely drive it back to battle again another day. Either way, the protagonist is rewarded for their courage and loyalty. They may be given a way to achieve their initial goal without losing their new Tribe, or they may move on from the goal entirely in pursuit of better things.",Ten Chapter Found Family Trope Fanfic Outline,t2ivcx,FanFiction,MyDearYoureNotAlice,1,1.0,0,0,/r/FanFiction/comments/t2ivcx/ten_chapter_found_family_trope_fanfic_outline/,1645947190,0,2022-02-27 10:33:10-05:00,2022-02-27,10:33:10,2,6,10,"Ten Chapter Found Family Trope Fanfic Outline There has been endless research and writing done on the topic of story  structure.

They have told me that they will contact me if there is new project and need more people to work on it. I'm living with my family paying bills. I have a technology degree but cant find jobs as my grades isn't up to the requirement. I am looking for and have sent my CV to different vacancies. Having 4+ years experience in warehouse my passion is still on games or something related to my degree. 

 I cant decide if I should wait for my QA job until they have new projects until then work warehouse to pay my bills or should I just go full time on warehouse. I know I can get better and go higher up on my warehouse but the QA job is what I love. The warehouse money is good related to the QA job and I can will be covering my bills with some extra left, but with the QA job I am barely getting by.

If anyone has had been in this situation please help 🙏. Good night and take care. 💜",What do I do next??help and advice please.

"Hopefully this is a good place for this question, here are the details

&amp;#x200B;

I am 24 and single, no kids/pets. I still live with my parents, my parents are moving to a tiny home so I will have to find my own place anyways. I have been making 15 an hour the past few years but am not unemployed (though in 3 months I could go back to work for the same contract company I did work for). I have been saving about 1/3-1/2 my pay check the past few years and have just over 30K saved.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently live in charleston SC but I recently intervied with microsft and have recieved an offer for a data center technician postion out in pheonix arizona

&amp;#x200B;

The offer is 23.65 base pay, with full benefits, stock options and 3 weeks PTO. additionaly i would be recieving an 8K relocation bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of job satisifaction. I think I would be happy as working in a data center is something I truely do enjoy (most of my job expierence is working in a data center, prior to that I worked f&amp;b which was okay but not for me).

&amp;#x200B;

I am nervous about moving across the country to a place where I wouldn't know anyone or anything really. But yet at the same time I am very excited about the job itself as I think it would be a great way to truely start a career.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else moved across the country before? Regardless of weather you have or haven't, what advice do you have? What are your thoughts, I would like a second or third opinion here.",Should I move across the country for a better job?,t0n57w,LifeAdvice,rickynerfcuber,1,1.0,0,1,/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t0n57w/should_i_move_across_the_country_for_a_better_job/,1645741284,1,2022-02-25 01:21:24-05:00,2022-02-25,01:21:24,2,4,1,"Should I move across the country for a better job?

"So I was wondering if there were others fanfic writers out there with ADHD.

I've started writing again after a hiatus of TEN YEARS! I have many unfinished semi-badly written stories I may or may not rewrite and finish (I try to avoid setting the bar too high).

A few things I'm dealing with:   
\- I have a perfectionistic coping style (YAY), so I hate reading my old stories.  
\- I tent to write too little context and when I notice it's missing, I write too much.  
\- I write in English, which is not my native language. It takes LOTS of time to write stuff out and my brain goes 713683561 times faster than what I can write.  
\- Visualizing the story is a real strength mine and helps with writing  
\- I write dragon ball Z fanfiction and lots of people still read this genre, but very few comment. Like that shit negatively fucks with my reward system :( I just want to learn to write for myself and better my writing skills!
